.Sh LIBRARY
libzip (-lzip)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In zip.h
.Ft int
.Fn zip_stat "struct zip *archive" "const char *fname" "int flags" "struct zip_stat *sb"
.Ft int
.Fn zip_stat_index "struct zip *archive" "int index" "int flags" "struct zip_stat *sb"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn zip_stat
function obtains information about the file named
.Ar fname
in
.Ar archive .
The
.Ar flags
argument specifies how the name lookup should be done.
Its values are described in
.Xr zip_name_locate 3 .
Also,
.Dv ZIP_FL_UNCHANGED
may be
.Em or Ns No 'ed
to it to request information about the original file in the archive,
ignoring any changes made.
.Pp
The
.Fn zip_stat_index
function obtains information about the file at position
.Ar index .
.Pp
The
.Ar sb
argument is a pointer to a
.Ft struct zip_stat
(shown below), into which information about the file is placed.
.Bd -literal
struct zip_stat {
    zip_uint64_t valid;                 /* which fields have valid values */
    const char *name;                   /* name of the file */
    zip_uint64_t index;                 /* index within archive */
    zip_uint64_t size;                  /* size of file (uncompressed) */
    zip_uint64_t comp_size;             /* size of file (compressed) */
    time_t mtime;                       /* modification time */
    zip_uint32_t crc;                   /* crc of file data */
    zip_uint16_t comp_method;           /* compression method used */
    zip_uint16_t encryption_method;     /* encryption method used */
    zip_uint32_t flags;                 /* reserved for future use */
};
.Ed
The structure pointed to by
.Ar sb
must be allocated before calling
.Fn zip_stat
or
.Fn zip_stat_index .
.Pp
The
.Ar valid
field of the structure specifies which other fields are valid.
Check if the flag defined by the following defines are in
.Ar valid
before accessing the fields:
.Bl -tag -width ZIP_STAT_ENCRYPTION_METHODXX -compact -offset indent
.It ZIP_STAT_NAME
.Ar name
.It ZIP_STAT_INDEX
.Ar index
.It ZIP_STAT_SIZE
.Ar size
.It ZIP_STAT_COMP_SIZE
.Ar comp_size
.It ZIP_STAT_MTIME
.Ar mtime
.It ZIP_STAT_CRC
.Ar crc
.It ZIP_STAT_COMP_METHOD
.Ar comp_method
.It ZIP_STAT_ENCRYPTION_METHOD
.Ar encryption_method
.It ZIP_STAT_FLAGS
.Ar flags
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion 0 is returned.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned and the error information in
.Ar archive
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The function
.Fn zip_stat
can fail for any of the errors specified for the routine
.Xr zip_name_locate 3 .
.Pp
The function
.Fn zip_stat_index
fails and sets the error information to
.Er ZIP_ER_INVAL
if
.Ar index
is invalid.
If
.Dv ZIP_FL_UNCHANGED
is not set and no information can be obtained from the source
callback, the error information is set to
.Er ZIP_ER_CHANGED .
