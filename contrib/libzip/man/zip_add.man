.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The function
zip_add
adds a file to a zip archive, while
zip_replace
replaces an existing file in a zip archive.
The argument
\fBarchive\fR
specifies the zip archive to which the file should be added.
\fBname\fR
is the file's name in the zip archive (for
zip_add ),
while
\fBindex\fR
specifies which file should be replaced (for
zip_replace ).
The data is obtained from the
\fBsource\fR
argument.
See the
zip_source_*
functions cited in
SEE ALSO.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Upon successful completion,
zip_add
returns the index of the new file in the archive, and
zip_replace
returns 0.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned and the error code in
\fBarchive\fR
is set to indicate the error.
