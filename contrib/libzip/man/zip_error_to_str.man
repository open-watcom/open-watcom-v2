.TH ZIP_ERROR_TO_STR 3 "March 10, 2009" NiH
.SH "NAME"
zip_error_to_str \- get string representation of zip error
.SH "LIBRARY"
libzip (-lzip)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
#include <zip.h>
.PP
int
zip_error_to_str(char *buf, zip_uint64_t len, int ze, int se);
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The
zip_error_to_str
function stores a string describing the libzip error code
\fBze\fR
in the user-provided buffer
\fBbuf\fR
which has size
\fBlen.\fR
The buffer is always NUL-terminated.
\fBse\fR
should be the value of the global variable
\fBerrno\fR
at the time of the error or the zlib error code, depending on
\fBze.\fR
.PP
zip_error_to_str
is especially useful if
zip_open
failed, since then there is no
.Vt struct zip
is available to store the error code; otherwise
zip_strerror
or
zip_file_strerror
are more convenient.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
zip_error_to_str
returns the number of characters that would have been written to a
sufficiently sized
\fBbuf,\fR
excluding the terminating NUL character.
