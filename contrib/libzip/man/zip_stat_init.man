#include <zip.h>

void
zip_stat_init(struct zip_stat *sb);
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The
zip_stat_init
function initializes the members of a struct zip_stat.
The current members are described in

make sure none are missed.
The structure pointed to by
\fBsb\fR
must be allocated before calling
zip_stat_init.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
If
\fBsb\fR
is valid, the function is always successful.
