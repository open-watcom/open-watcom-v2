.Sh NAME
.Nm zip_fdopen
.Nd open zip archive using open file descriptor
.Sh LIBRARY
libzip (-lzip)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In zip.h
.Ft struct zip *
.Fn zip_fdopen "int fd" "int flags" "int *errorp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The zip archive specified by the open file descriptor
.Ar fd
is opened and a pointer to a
.Ft struct zip ,
used to manipulate the archive, is returned.
In contrast to
.Xr zip_open 3 ,
using
.Nm zip_fdopen
the archive can only be opened in read-only mode.
The
.Ar fd
argument may not be used any longer after calling
.Nm zip_fdopen .
The
.Fa flags
are specified by
.Em or Ns No 'ing
the following values, or 0 for none of them.
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width ZIP_CHECKCONS
.It Dv ZIP_CHECKCONS
Perform additional consistency checks on the archive, and error if
they fail.
.El
.Pp
If an error occurs and
.Ar errorp
is
.No non- Ns Dv NULL ,
it will be set to the corresponding error code.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion
.Fn zip_fdopen
returns a
.Ft struct zip
pointer, and
.Ar fd
should not be used any longer, nor passed to
.Xr close 2 .
Otherwise,
.Dv NULL
is returned and
.Ar *errorp
is set to indicate the error.
In the error case,
.Ar fd
remains unchanged.
