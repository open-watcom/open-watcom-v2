.SH "NAME"
zip_source_zip \- create data source from zip file
.SH "LIBRARY"
libzip (-lzip)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
#include <zip.h>
.PP
struct zip_source *
zip_source_zip(struct zip *archive, struct zip *srcarchive); \
"zip_uint64_t srcidx" "int flags" "zip_uint64_t start" "zip_int64_t len"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The function
zip_source_zip
creates a zip source from a file in a zip archive.
The
\fBsrcarchive\fR
argument is the (open) zip archive containing the source zip file
at index
\fBsrcidx.\fR
\fBlen\fR
bytes from offset
\fBstart\fR
will be used in the zip_source.
If
\fBlen\fR
is 0 or \-1, the rest of the file, starting from
\fBstart,\fR
is used.
If
\fBstart\fR
is zero and
\fBlen\fR
is \-1, the whole file will be copied without decompressing it.
.PP
Supported flags are:
.RS
.TP 23
\fBZIP_FL_UNCHANGED\fR
Try to get the original data without any changes that may have been
made to
\fBsrcarchive\fR
after opening it.
.TP 23
\fBZIP_FL_RECOMPRESS\fR
When adding the data from
\fBsrcarchive,\fR
re-compress it using the current settings instead of copying the
compressed data.
.RE
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Upon successful completion, the created source is returned.
Otherwise,
\fBNULL\fR
is returned and the error code in
\fBarchive\fR
is set to indicate the error.
