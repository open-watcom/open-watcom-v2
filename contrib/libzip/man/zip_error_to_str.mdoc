.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm zip_error_to_str
.Nd get string representation of zip error
.Sh LIBRARY
libzip (-lzip)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In zip.h
.Ft int
.Fn zip_error_to_str "char *buf" "zip_uint64_t len" "int ze" "int se"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn zip_error_to_str
function stores a string describing the libzip error code
.Ar ze
in the user-provided buffer
.Ar buf
which has size
.Ar len .
The buffer is always NUL-terminated.
.Ar se
should be the value of the global variable
.Ar errno
at the time of the error or the zlib error code, depending on
.Ar ze .
.Pp
.Fn zip_error_to_str
is especially useful if
.Fn zip_open
failed, since then there is no
.Vt struct zip
is available to store the error code; otherwise
.Fn zip_strerror
or
.Fn zip_file_strerror
are more convenient.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn zip_error_to_str
returns the number of characters that would have been written to a
sufficiently sized
.Ar buf ,
excluding the terminating NUL character.
