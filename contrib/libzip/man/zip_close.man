.TH ZIP_CLOSE 3 "February 15, 2009" NiH
.SH "NAME"
zip_close \- close zip archive
.SH "LIBRARY"
libzip (-lzip)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
#include <zip.h>
.PP
int
zip_close(struct zip *archive);
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The
zip_close
function closes
\fBarchive\fR
and frees the memory allocated for it.
If any files within were changed, those changes are written to disk
first.
If writing changes fails,
zip_close
fails and
\fBarchive\fR
is left unchanged.
If
\fBarchive\fR
contains no files, the file is completely removed (no empty archive is
written).
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Upon successful completion 0 is returned.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned and the error code in
\fBarchive\fR
is set to indicate the error.
