<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">- DOS/32 Advanced could
not find and/or open application file &quot;%s&quot; specified on the command

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">- DOS/32 Advanced supports
up to 64 Objects per application. Rebuild your program so that the executable
contains no more than 64 Objects.</font></p>

<p><tt>DOS/32A fatal (4002): not enough DOS memory to load application exec
</tt></p>

conventional (DOS) memory to load your application. Rebuild your program
so that it occupies less memory, free some of conventional memory or reconfigure

<p><tt>DOS/32A fatal (4004): not enough extended memory to load fixups for
%s </tt></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">- DOS/32 Advanced could
not load fixups for file &quot;%s&quot; because of extended memory shortage.
This problem often arises when a DOS/32 Advanced application was spawned
from non-compatible DOS Extender. Try to replace the DOS Extender for the
program that spawned DOS/32 Advanced, make sure you have enough extended
memory.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><center><hr size="1"></center></p>

<p><tt>DOS/32A fatal (4005): unrecognized fixup data in application exec
&quot;%s&quot; </tt></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">- The program was loaded,
but could not be relocated because of bad fixup data records. Either an
error occurred at link time or the application was corrupted in some way.
It is also possible that DOS/32 Advanced does not support a fixup record
in &quot;%s&quot;. Recompile, recopy or rebuild application file &quot;%s&quot;.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><center><hr size="1"></center></p>

<p><tt>DOS/32A fatal (4006): 16bit fixup overflow in application exec &quot;%s&quot;
</tt></p>

<p><center><hr size="1"></center></p>

<p><tt>DOS/32A fatal (4007): not enough DOS Transfer Buffer space to load
LC-exec &quot;%s&quot;</tt></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">- DOS/32 Advanced cannot
load Linear Compressed executable &quot;%s&quot; because the size of DOS
Transfer Buffer is set too small. Reconfigure the DOS Extender and set DOS
Transfer Buffer size to any value that is equal to or is greater than 8KB
(8192 bytes).</font></p>

<p><tt>DOS/32A warning (9001): no extended memory had been allocated </tt></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">- DOS/32 Advanced could
not allocate any extended memory. Note that when an external DPMI host and
a VCPI server are present at the same time, and DOS/32 Advanced is configured
to detect VCPI first, no extended memory can be available due to the fact
that the DPMI host might have already allocated it all. Another possibility
is that a DOS/32 Advanced application was spawned from a software incompatible
with DOS/32 Advanced in the matter of extended memory allocation. Finally,
DOS/32 Advanced might have been configured to not allocate any extended
memory at all. Reconfigure DOS/32 Advanced. Make sure that the software,
from which the application was spawned is DOS/32 Advanced compatible. Replace
memory manager.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><center><hr size="1"></center></p>

<p><tt>DOS/32A warning (9002): PICs have been relocated to INT %bh, INT
%bh </tt></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">- Programmable Interrupt
Controllers (PICs) have been remapped by the previously run/installed software.
The first number will show the current mapping of the master PIC, the second,
mapping of the slave PIC.</font></p>

<p><center><hr size="1"></center></p>

<p><tt>DOS/32A warning (9003): real mode interrupt vector had been modified:
INT %bh </tt></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">- This warning will be
issued on your protected mode program's exit. It will inform you that the
protected mode program that was just run, did install a real mode interrupt
&quot;%b&quot;, or did modify the real mode interrupt vector table in some
other way, but it did not restore the original value of &quot;%b&quot;.
Note that many protected mode programs do not care for restoring certain
real mode interrupts, such as INT 1Ch, INT 23h and INT 24h. However, since
DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender will restore the whole real mode interrupt
vector table on exit to DOS (unless this option is disabled), this will
usually do no harm to the system.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><center><hr size="1"></center></p>

<p><tt>DOS/32A warning (9004): mouse initialization failed </tt></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">- Either mouse driver
was not installed, or the mouse driver is incompatible with DOS/32 Advanced
in some way. This warning may also be issued if the Low Buffer size is set
to a value below 4096 bytes.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><center><hr size="1"></center></p>
<p><tt>DOS/32A warning (9005): object #%d contains no data or code </tt></p>
<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">- This warning will be
reported when a protected mode application contains Objects with the size
of zero (empty Objects). Normally, the linker will automatically remove
such Objects from the application, unless they are referenced from somewhere
in the program.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><center><hr size="1"></center></p>
<p><tt>DOS/32A warning (9006): incompatible version of DOS/32A already running </tt></p>
<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">- This warning will be
issued when spawning a DOS/32 Advanced application from another DOS/32 Advanced
program, and the DOS Extenders' versions are not compatible (ie they have
different versions). Make sure that all the applications that are to be spawned
run under one and the same version of DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><center><hr size="1"></center></p>
<p><tt>DOS/32A run-time (6000): unknown error code (#%b) </tt></p>
<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">- DOS/32 Advanced Terminate
Program on Error routine was called with unknown error code. This can happen
when a protected mode program improperly installs exception handlers.</font></p>

<p><tt>DOS/32A run-time (6002): out of real-mode virtual stacks </tt></p>
<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">- DOS/32 Advanced run
out of real-mode virtual stacks. This can happen when a protected mode program
makes too many nested calls to real mode software. Make sure that you configured
DOS/32 Advanced properly. Check that the timer is not reprogrammed to run
at a frequency that is too high for the CPU and the rest of the hardware.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><center><hr size="1"></center></p>

<p><tt>DOS/32A run-time (6003): out of protected-mode virtual stacks </tt></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">- DOS/32 Advanced run
out of protected-mode virtual stacks. This can happen when a real mode software

<p><tt>DOS/32A run-time (6004): extended memory blocks have been destroyed
</tt></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">- Each time DOS/32 Advanced
built-in DPMI functions 05xxh (extended memory management) are called, the
integrity of already allocated extended memory blocks will be checked. If
DOS/32 Advanced detects that the blocks had been overwritten or corrupted
in some other way (happens when a program writes to memory it had not allocated),
this error will be reported.</font></p>

<p><tt>DOS/32A run-time (6005): DOS/4G API calls not supported </tt></p>

extensions.</font></p>
