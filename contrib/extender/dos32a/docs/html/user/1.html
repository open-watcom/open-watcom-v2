<p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">1.0 - DOS/32 Advanced - Overview</font></b></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><br>
DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender, also referred to as DOS/32A, is a 32-bit high-performance,
high-speed DOS Extender which can be used as a true &quot;Plug&amp;Play&quot;
replacement of DOS/4G, DOS/4GW and DOS/4GW Professional DOS Extenders. That
is, DOS/32 Advanced can be &quot;plugged&quot; into a protected mode application
that is written for, and works with one of the above said DOS Extenders
without any modifications required to be done to the application itself.</font></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender
has been designed to offer the highest performance possible at the cost of
low DOS Extender executable size, well maintained compatibility, and incredible
flexibility. Thus, programs written to work exclusively with DOS/4G(W) line
DOS Extenders will, when run under DOS/32 Advanced gain increase in the
performance. In fact, DOS/32 Advanced is capable of nearly doubling the
performance of certain programs, especially those programs which
extensively use disk I/O, spawn other applications or are highly dependent on the speed of the
hardware/software interrupt processing (such as embedded system applications).
</font></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender
also offers an unique capability of being manually reconfigured by the user.
A special Setup utility provided with DOS/32 Advanced allows easy and quick
reconfiguration of the DOS Extender, and features over thirty different
options which directly or indirectly affect DOS/32 Advanced compatibility
and performance.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">There are probably over
a billion good reasons why you would want to choose DOS/32 Advanced over
all other DOS Extenders available on the market today, but here are probably
the most important ones:</font></p>

<p><br></p>

<ul>
  <li><b><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Speed!</font></b><font
   size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"> DOS/32 Advanced is the fastest
  DOS Extender among those which are compatible with DOS/4GW. DOS/32 Advanced
  features lightning fast mode translation operations, extremely fast disk
  I/O not to forget the short startup times due to DOS/32 Advanced low size
  of executable and very fast processing of hardware and software interrupts
  which plays the essential role when accessing real mode DOS.</font>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><b><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Compatibility!</font></b><font
   size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"> DOS/32 Advanced features one
  of the best software emulations of DOS/4G(W) line DOS Extenders, and supports
  most of DOS/4G features, thus being compatible with a very large number
  of applications which are written to work with DOS/4G(W). Furthermore,
  DOS/32 Advanced was very carefully designed to be compatible with all major
  Operating Systems available on the market. In fact, DOS/32 Advanced has
  been tested on many different computers with the most unusual configurations
  and software systems installed just to prove its full compatibility with
  those.</font>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><b><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Flexibility!</font></b><font
   size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"> There are hundreds of ways of
  different possible configurations supported by DOS/32 Advanced. Yet, being
  easy to reconfigure, DOS/32 Advanced becomes a powerful tool in the hands
  of people who intend to use it. Each configuration option and feature can
  be used to fine tune the DOS Extender's performance and speed as well as
  to solve any possible problems.</font>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">There are four powerful
utility programs and a protected mode diagnostic program provided with DOS/32
Advanced DOS Extender:</font></p>

<p><br></p>

<ul>
  <li><b><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
  <a href="../util/1.html">SUNSYS Bind Utility</a></font></b><font
   size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"> program which allows you to
  unbind DOS Extenders or stub programs from protected mode programs and
  replace them with DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender.</font>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><b><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
  <a href="../util/2.html">SUNSYS Compress Utility</a></font></b><font
   size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"> program which allows compression
  of protected mode executables of LE- and LX-style file formats into DOS/32
  Advanced natively supported Linear Compressed (LC-style) file format.</font>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><b><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
  <a href="../util/3.html">SUNSYS Setup Utility</a></font></b><font
   size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"> program which allows you to
  manually reconfigure DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender and STUB/32C Configurable
  Stubs.</font>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><b><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
  <a href="../util/4.html">SUNSYS Debugger</a></font></b><font
   size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"> which allows protected mode
  programmers to debug 16-bit and 32-bit protected mode applications under
  DOS/32 Advanced.</font>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><b><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">SUNSYS Protected
  Mode Diagnostic Utility</font></b><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
  program which measures the speed of your computer when running under different
  DOS Extenders. PCTEST will recognize and run under DOS/4G, DOS/4GW, DOS/4GW
  Professional, Causeway, PMODE/W and of course under DOS/32 Advanced DOS
  Extenders.</font>
