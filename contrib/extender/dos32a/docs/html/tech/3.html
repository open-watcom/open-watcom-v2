</font><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">3.0 - DOS/32 Advanced -
The Loader<br>
</font></b></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The Loader is currently
capable of loading the "LE", "LX" and "LC"(*) formats of 32-bit protected mode
programs. The Objects can be loaded into both conventional (DOS) and extended
(High) memories, but by default the loader will load all Objects into extended
memory to emulate DOS/4GW DOS Extender.</font></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">An Object is a part of
your protected mode program, that can be either 16-bit or 32-bit and have
attributes of CODE or DATA. The Objects can be seen as segments you declare
in the program when you create your protected mode application. To be more
exact, segments which have the same Class, or which are grouped into the
same Group, will be put into one and the same Object. A typical WATCOM program
will have two Objects: one 32-bit CODE Object containing BEGTEXT and TEXT
segments (both have the same Class: CODE) and one 32-bit DATA Object containing
the rest of declared segments, including the STACK (grouped into DGROUP
group).</font></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">DOS/32 Advanced allows
you to separate the 16-bit Objects and 32-bit Objects (place them in different
memories, conventional and extended). The 16-bit Objects can be loaded into
DOS memory directly, while the 32-bit Objects are still loaded into High
memory.</font></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">For each loaded Object,
the Loader will allocate a protected mode selector that will be set to 16-bit
if the Object was declared as a 16-bit Object and to 32-bit if the Object
was declared as a 32-bit Object. Please note that the 32-bit Objects which have
the same attributes will share one and the same selector. That is, if the
Loader is loading an Object with attributes of DATA/32-bit, and there is
already a selector allocated for an Object loaded previously, that had the
same attributes, the both Objects will share the same selector. This will
not be the case for the 16-bit Objects which will have different selectors
each.</font></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">For 32-bit Objects the
DOS Extender will set the allocated selector's base to 0, and
the limit to -1 (4GB). The 16-bit Objects' bases will be set to the
base memory addresses, at which they were loaded, and the limits to the
sizes of the Objects.</font></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The loader is capable
of loading the maximum of 64 Objects per application. If you have more than
64 Objects in your application, you must rebuild it, or the DOS Extender
will report an error &quot;too many objects...&quot;.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">When all the Objects are
loaded into memory, they will be relocated. The relocation is a process,
when the Loader reads fixups and applies them to the loaded Object data.
When you linking your program, the linker, as it has no knowledge of what
addresses the Objects will be loaded at later, will place a fixup for each
CPU command (instruction) that uses a linear (not absolute) address. Consider
the following example in the assembly language:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  <font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
  <i>
  mov esi,0A0000h<br>
  mov edi,offset _buffer_addr<br>
  mov ecx,0800h<br>
  rep movsd
  </i>
  </font>
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The first instruction,
contains an absolute address, 0A0000h, and thus no fixup will be generated
by the linker for it. But the second instruction uses a linear address of
variable <i>_buffer_addr</i> which is declared somewhere else in the
program. The linker will therefore know only the linear address of variable
<i>_buffer_addr</i> (the address relative to the beginning of the segment
in which the variable is declared) and will place a fixup (this linear address)
into fixup table in your protected mode application. When the Loader relocates
a program, it reads the fixup (linear address), adds it to the base memory
address, at which the Object was loaded, and patches the instruction that
needs to be patched. This process is repeated for each Object until all
instructions in all Objects are relocated. The fewer relocations a program
has, the faster it is relocated, and therefore the faster it is loaded.</font></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">What is an &quot;unrelocated
address&quot;, you may ask. Look at the text just above. The unrelocated
address is simply the linear address that was generated by the linker and
put as a fixup into the fixup table. That is the linear address of a variable
relative to the beginning of the segment, in which the variable was declared.
When DOS/32 Advanced reports an error on exception occurred in your program,
it will, if it can, always report the unrelocated address of the faulting
instruction, along with the absolute (often =physical) address.</font></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The Loader in DOS/32 Advanced
can not load all types "LX" or "LE" applications, which depends on the factum
that not all of fixup types are supported. Please note that all the programs
created for DOS/4GW will be loaded by DOS/32 Advanced without any problems.
Though, if you attempt to load a Windows VxD (which also use the "LE" file format)
with DOS/32 Advanced Loader, you will probably get an error &quot;unsupported
fixup...&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The supported fixup types
are listed below:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
  <li>Byte fixups<br>
  <li>16-bit Selector fixups<br>
  <li>16:16-bit Pointer fixups<br>
  <li>16-bit Offset fixups<br>
  <li>16:32-bit Pointer fixups<br>
  <li>32-bit Offset fixups<br>
  <li>32-bit Self-Relative Offset fixups</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">When your protected mode
application is loaded and relocated, DOS/32 Advanced will setup a protected
mode stack and segment registers for it and jump to the program's entry
point. Note that your program may have an entry point in a 16-bit Object
as well as in 32-bit.</font></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">When protected mode program
is executed, the general and segment<br>
registers of the CPU will be in the following state:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">EAX = 0<br>
  EBX = 0<br>
  ECX = 0<br>
  EDX = 0<br>
  ESI = 0<br>
  EDI = 0<br>
  EBP = 0<br>
  ESP = points to the top of protected mode stack</font></p>
  <p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
  CS = 32-bit code selector with base=0 and limit=4GB<br>
  DS = 32-bit data selector with base=0 and limit=4GB<br>
  ES = 32-bit data selector with base=PSP and limit=256 bytes<br>
  SS = 32-bit data selector with base=0 and limit=4GB<br>
  FS = 32-bit data selector with base=0 and limit=4GB<br>
  GS = NULL selector (0000h)</font></p>
  <p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
  interrupts enabled, direction flag clear, and DS=SS
  </font></p>
  <p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
  the FS register will contain a selector internal to
  DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender, which should
  not be modified or freed by your program.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size=-2 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">(*) <b>Note:</b><br>
The Linear Compressed file format, also refered to as &quot;LC&quot;
file format, is a modified version of "LE"/"LX"-style executables
developed in conjuction to support protected mode executable compression.
Although the primary goal of the LC file format is to allow compression
of 16-bit and 32-bit protected mode executables, its
intention is also to provide certain level of security for protected mode
programmers and prevent unwanted intrusion into the application's code.
The LC compressed executables, once compressed, cannot be decompressed,
debugged or reverse-engineered, which ensures the authors of the original
code in that the developed application will not be modified, and the users
of the application in its genuinity.
