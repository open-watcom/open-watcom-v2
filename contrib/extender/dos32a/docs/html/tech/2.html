</font><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">2.0 - DOS/32 Advanced -
Startup<br>
</font></b></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
In general, the DOS Extender will take the following actions when started:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
  <li> detect if enough conventional
  (DOS) memory is present to run<br>
  <li> detect system software type: Clean (INT 15h), XMS, VCPI or DPMI<br>
  <li> initialize the present system, allocate extended memory and enter the
  protected mode</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">After having successfully entered
the protected mode, the loader will be executed and will attempt to load
your 16/32-bit protected mode application. When the program is loaded into memory,
it will be executed.</font></p>

<p><br></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">At the very startup of
the DOS Extender, DOS/32 Advanced will detect the type of the CPU and FPU
installed into the machine on which the DOS Extender is currently running. DOS/32
Advanced will correctly detect and identify different CPU types manufactured
by different CPU vendors. The FPU will be detected and initialized as well
and will be reset to hold zeroes only. After that, DOS/32 Advanced will
try to detect and initialize the underlying system software.</font></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">When the system software
is detected to be Clean, XMS or VCPI, the built-in DPMI host of DOS/32 Advanced
will attempt to allocate the extended memory from the system.
Note that the extended memory that is to be allocated by
the DOS Extender, will be allocated once at startup, not in blocks when
you call DPMI functions 05xxh. This may explain why under VCPI there will
be a delay when the DOS Extender is started, since some VCPI servers (for
example <i>emm386.exe</i>) will require additional time to test and
map pages into pagetables.</font></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Under Clean and XMS systems,
DOS/32 Advanced will also enable the A20 line, which will allow the DOS
Extender to get an access to the extended memory. On exit, the state of
the A20 line will be restored, ie if it was enabled, it will not be disabled
by the DOS Extender. Note that under Clean system, the DOS Extender will
always leave the A20 line enabled when exiting to DOS.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The built-in DPMI host
will, when installed, preserve the following interrupts in real mode:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">INT 1Bh (CTRL-BREAK)<br>
  INT 1Ch (Timer ticks)<br>
  INT 21h (DOS API)<br>
  INT 23h (CTRL-C)<br>
  INT 24h (Critical handler)<br>
  INT 2Fh (Multiplex)</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">These real mode interrupts
will be restored on exit to DOS no matter how the DOS Extender was configured,
since they are the keys to important system resources. That means that your
protected mode program can not install these interrupts for later use by
programs in real mode when the protected mode program is terminated and
the DOS is running. Please also note that the real mode DOS itself will
restore interrupts 23h and 24h when performing its cleanup after the program
issued INT 21h AH=4Ch.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Four callbacks will be
allocated by the built-in DPMI to send the following real mode interrupts
from real mode to protected mode:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">INT 1Bh (CTRL-BREAK)<br>
  INT 1Ch (Timer ticks)<br>
  INT 23h (CTRL-C)<br>
  INT 24h (Critical handler)</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Please note that these
real mode callbacks will not be installed unless you install the corresponding
interrupts in protected mode.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Three software interrupts
will be installed in protected mode by the DOS Extender:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">INT 10h (Video BIOS API)<br>
  INT 21h (DOS API)<br>
  INT 33h (Mouse API)</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">These interrupts in protected
mode will extend the corresponding real mode interrupts, ie convert protected
mode pointers to real mode values, perform buffered reads/writes and so
on.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The interrupt INT 21h
will be trapped by the built-in DPMI in the both real and protected modes.
In the real mode, DOS function AH=4Ch (Terminate Program) will be sent to
a protected mode termination routine. This will ensure that if a real mode
program tries to terminate your protected mode program (for example when
you have not installed protected mode INT 1Bh, CTRL-BREAK, but you use that
key combination anyway), the extended memory will be deallocated by the
built-in DPMI and the protected mode program will be terminated in the proper
way.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The DOS Extender will
also try to initialize a mouse driver, first using a software reset function
AX=0021h, and if it fails/not supported by the mouse driver use a hardware
reset function AX=0000h. If both calls return an error, the DOS Extender
will assume that no mouse/mouse driver is present and will redirect the
protected mode INT 33h to an IRETD instruction causing any calls to INT
33h in protected mode to return without performing any action.</font></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">If a mouse/mouse driver
was successfully detected, the DOS Extender will allocate a callback for
the extended mouse function 000Ch which will be used to inform the protected
mode handler of mouse events.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">After the DOS Extender
and DPMI have been initialized, DOS/32 Advanced will load and execute your
protected mode program.</font></p>
