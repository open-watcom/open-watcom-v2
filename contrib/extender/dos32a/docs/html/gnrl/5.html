<br></font></b></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
    DOS/32  Advanced  DOS Extender is  compatible  with nearly any Operating
System available, given that the OS can provide an MS-DOS like subset of low
level  functions  and  commands required by the DOS Extender  for its proper
operation.  DOS/32  Advanced has been tested  on,  and  proved to be fully
compatible  with  the following OS listed:  MS-DOS&reg;  versions 5.00 thru 8.000,
Microsoft Windows&reg; version 3.xx, Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows ME,
Windows NT versions 3.51 and 4.0 (Service Pack 3 or later), Windows 2000, Windows XP and  IBM OS/2.
According  to the reports from DOS/32 Advanced  users  the DOS Extender has
proven its compatibility with OpenDOS and Linux (DOS Emu) Operating Systems.

    Reportedly,  DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender  has shown its incompatibility
with  Multiuser DOS 7 Gold Operating System developed by <a href="http://www.conctrls.com">Concurrent Controls</a>
(formerly  Digital  Research)  company. Please take  a  note of our official
statement:  we  have not tested DOS/32A  on MDOS hosted machines internally,
and  therefore  we  cannot confirm any  potential  problems between the said
Operating  System  and DOS/32 Advanced DOS  Extender, nor can we provide any
technical support in the case of combination of the two above said software.
