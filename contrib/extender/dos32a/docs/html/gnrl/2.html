2.0 - DOS/32 Advanced - What's New?
<br></font></b></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
    This  new version of DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender has been optimized for
use  in embedded system environments where  size, speed and reliability play
the  essential role. Improved protected mode  kernel, removal of major parts
of  the DOS Extender from conventional memory after initialization, improved
exception  handling, support for performance counters and protected mode TSR
(Terminate and Stay Resident) development as well as Year 2000 compliance
are the examples  of the new features  found in the DOS Extender. A new
high-performance library provided with the DOS Extender allows developers to
take  advantage of the most features found in DOS/32 Advanced and improve
performance of protected mode applications.
