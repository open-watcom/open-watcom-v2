1.0 - DOS/32 Advanced - About
<br></font></b></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
    DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender is a state-of-the-art,  high-performance,
high-speed,  true  "Plug&Play" replacement of  the  world's most popular DOS
Extender,  DOS/4GW, created by Tenberry  Software (formerly Rational Systems
Inc.)  for WATCOM  C/C++ and FORTRAN  77 compilers which allow  DOS Extended
applications to run in a 32-bit flat protected mode environment.
</font></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
    DOS/32  Advanced  DOS Extender provides  full  compatibility with WATCOM
C/C++  and features one of the most complete software emulations of DOS/4GW,
thus  allowing  the users to "plug"  DOS/32 Advanced into the protected mode
programs  which  use  DOS/4G, DOS/4GW,  DOS/4GW  Professional  and any other
compatible DOS Extenders without the need in modifying a single line of code.
</font></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
    DOS/32  Advanced has been designed and optimized to be the fastest, most
flexible and highly compatible with other software DOS Extender. It performs
mode translating operations, such as Protected to Real and Real To Protected
mode  switching,  as  fast  as machine's  hardware  allow,  and  while being
compatible with DOS/4GW, it is the fastest DOS Extender that supports WATCOM
C/C++  at  this time! A large  number  of configuration options allow DOS/32
Advanced  to  be configured in hundreds  different ways, either by a special
environment  variable or by an external  setup program, giving its users the
ability  to  manually adjust the  number  of allocated selectors, callbacks,
virtual  stacks,  turn  off the exception  handling,  change the size of DOS
transfer  buffer and much, much more. Compatibility with "Clean" (also known
as  "Raw"  or  INT 15h), XMS, VCPI  and  DPMI system softwares allows DOS/32
Advanced  DOS  Extender to run on  different machines with various operating
systems   installed.   Additionally,  availability   of   such  features  as
Null-Pointer  Protection,  Extended Memory Blocks  Checking  and support for
built-in Debug Mode turns DOS/32 Advanced into a powerful tool for protected
mode  programmers who want to make  their 32-bit protected mode applications
error-free.
