<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<b>Report Warnings</b> <i>Default: ON</i><br>
When turned on, the DOS Extender  will report any encountered warnings to
the  user. When turned off, only fatal and run-time errors will be displayed
on the screen.
</font></p>


<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<b>Sound Alert on Run-Time Errors</b> <i>Default: ON</i><br>
When turned on, the run-time errors will be accompanied by a tone from the
PC  speaker,  to indicate that the program  had crashed. This way, even when
the  machine  state has been corrupted so that it cannot be restored, and no
report can be written on the screen, you will still be
informed  of  an  error  in the  program.  Note  that  only run-time errors,
(exceptions  for example) will be accompanied by a tone, on fatal errors and
warnings the computer will stay quiet (as my hamster was when it died).
</font></p>


<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<b>Restore Real Mode INTs on Exit</b> <i>Default: ON</i><br>
When turned on, the whole real mode interrupt table (all 256 vectors) will
be  saved upon the DOS Extender's startup, and  restored on exit. Note that the DOS Extender
will  not restore the real mode IRQs possibly installed by your program
separately from the real mode interrupt
vectors,  so  you must turn on this option  if you are installing an IRQ and
are  not  planning  to restore it, or  if  you  are having trouble with
protected mode applications which on exit reboot the computer.
</font></p>


<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<b>Report Modified Real Mode INTs</b> <i>Default: ON</i><br>
This  option controls whether the real  mode  interrupt vectors are to be
reported  when  modified by a protected mode  program  upon its exit to DOS.
When  turned on, the modified interrupts will  be reported to the user as a
warning 9001. Note
that  many protected mode programs install their own IRQ handlers,
which  causes  DOS/32  Advanced  DOS Extender  to  install   real mode IRQ
callbacks  for  those,  but  when   returning  to  DOS, the programs do not
restore  the  installed interrupts. The examples of such interrupts
are  INT 08h, INT 09h, and INTs 1Bh, 23h and 24h.
</font></p>


<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<b>Object Loading Scheme</b> <i>Default: #4</i><br>
This  option  gives you the ability  to  manually control how the Objects
(parts  of  your  protected mode program)  are    loaded into memory when
DOS/32  Advanced  starts  your  program.  There  are  four different schemes
available:
</font></p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
	<td bgcolor="#dcdcdc"><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
	#1:
	</font>
	</td>
	<td bgcolor="#e4e4e4"><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
	Load the both 16-bit and 32-bit Objects into the conventional (DOS) memory first, when not
	enough DOS memory, load them into extended (High) memory.
	</font>
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td bgcolor="#dcdcdc"><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
	#2:
	</font>
	</td>
	<td bgcolor="#e4e4e4"><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
	Load the 16-bit Objects into conventional (DOS) memory, when not enough, start loading them
	into extended memory. The 32-bit Objects are loaded into extended memory only.
	</font>
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td bgcolor="#dcdcdc"><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
	#3:
	</font>
	</td>
	<td bgcolor="#e4e4e4"><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
	Load the both 16-bit and 32-bit Objects into conventional (DOS) memory, when not enough
	report an error and exit.
	</font>
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td bgcolor="#dcdcdc"><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
	#4:
	</font>
	</td>
	<td bgcolor="#e4e4e4"><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
	Load the both 16-bit and 32-bit Objects into extended memory, when not
	enough report an error and exit (DOS/4GW compatible).
	</font>
	</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>



<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
    Note  that  when the Objects are loaded  using scheme #2, the 16-bit ones
will  be loaded into conventional (DOS) memory by default, and there will be
no  need  in  copying  them from the extended  memory  to  DOS memory to make it
possible  for the real mode DOS to get an  access  to them. However you have to
check  if the Objects are really loaded low,  as if there was not enough DOS
memory, they will be loaded high anyway.

    The  scheme  #4 is DOS/4GW compatible:  all the Objects are loaded
high,  and you will have to copy the 16-bit ones into DOS memory and allocate
16-bit selectors for them manually.
</font></p>


<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<b>Object Alignment when Loaded High</b> <i>Default: PARA</i><br>
This option defines the alignment of the Objects that are loaded high, ie
into extended memory. The default setting is PARA, paragraph alignment which
is  16 bytes. Optionally you can change  it to PAGE, page alignment which is
4096  bytes. Note that DOS/4GW always uses PAGE alignment when
loading  Objects,  but the PARA alignment is  much more efficient as it does
not  create  large  empty  spaces between  allocated  memory  blocks.  It is
recommended  that  you always use the  PARA  alignment as most programs will
work  fine  no  matter what alignment you  choose,  and  it will by the rule
increase  the  amount of free extended  memory  available for your protected
mode program. Also note that Objects that are loaded low, ie in the conventional
memory, will always be PARA aligned.
</font></p>


<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<b>Clear Screen on Run-Time Errors</b> <i>Default: OFF</i><br>
This option controls whether the screen is to be cleared and the DOS text
mode  (BIOS videomode 03h) is to be set whenever an exception is encountered
in  your program. When turned off, and  an exception occurs while the screen
is  in the BIOS-not-supported videomode (for  example so called mode-x), you
will be most likely seeing garbage.
</font></p>


<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<b>Start Full-Screen under Windows</b> <i>Default: OFF</i><br>
When this option is turned on,  and your program is running under Windows
(v3.x and 4.x) the DOS Extender will automatically switch the application to
the  full-screen mode if the program was started from a DOS-box window. Note
that  if  your application is already  running  full-screen this option will
have no effect on the program.
</font></p>


<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<b>Install Null-Pointer Protection</b> <i>Default: OFF</i><br>
When turned on, the DOS  Extender will install a Null-Pointer protection,
which  will  write-protect the first sixteen  bytes  at the beginning of the
memory  (at  absolute address 0:00000000h).
</font></p>


<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<b>Show Copyright Banner at Startup</b> <i>Default: ON</i><br>
With this option you can disable the copyright banner which is by default
shown at DOS Extender's startup.
</font></p>


<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<b>Configure Using Environment</b> <i>Default: ON</i><br>
When  turned  on,  the environment  variable,  <b>DOS32A</b>,  will be carefully
examined  by the DOS Extender and  if it contains any important information,
the  DOS Extender will configure itself according to what it read. Note that
the DOS Extender will in the first place configure itself using the built-in
values  that  are  placed in a special  header  inside  every copy of DOS/32
Advanced.  Only  in  the second place will  it  read  the environment and if
<b>DOS32A</b>  environment  variable  is  defined, the  values  read  from  it will
override  the  built-in  settings. You
can think of built-in configuration as of "local", and of <b>DOS32A</b> environment
configuration as of "global".
</font></p>


<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<b>Start Extender in Verbose Mode</b> <i>Default: OFF</i><br>
This option will allow you to see what is going on while the DOS Extender
is  loading  your program. This can be  useful when you need to know exactly
how  much memory there is available, where in memory the DOS Extender loaded
your  application's Objects, and what startup conditions there were when the
program was started.
</font></p>


<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<b>DOS Transfer Buffer Size</b> <i>Default: 8KB</i><br>
This option specifies the size of  the DOS Transfer Buffer in bytes. This
buffer will be used by the DOS Extender when moving data from protected mode
memory to DOS memory and back. Note that some of the DOS extended functions will
require  this buffer to be at least  4KB large. Also, the internal to DOS/32
Advanced  value is stored in paragraphs, rather  than in bytes as shown, and
thus  the entered numbers will be truncated by 16, (Buffer Size AND 0xFFF0).
The maximum size of the buffer is 64KB.<br>
<br>
    Note  that  when  using DOS/32  Advanced  Linear  Compressed native file
format (the LC-style executable file format), the buffer size is required to
be at least 8KB.
