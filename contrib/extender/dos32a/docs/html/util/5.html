5.0 - DOS/32 Advanced - Programming Advices

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
    You  should consider the following  when programming for DOS/32 Advanced
DOS Extender or porting already written applications to it:
</font></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
    Remember,  if  your  program  does  not  work  with  DOS/32  Advanced as
expected,  first always try to reconfigure it. Do not blame the DOS Extender
for  being broken in the first  place. Try different configurations provided
with  DOS/32 Advanced located in  <i>.\D32</i> directory  and see if they help. Use
<i>dos4gw.d32</i>  configuration to force DOS/32  Advanced to emulate DOS/4GW DOS
Extender as close as possible.

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<b>Advice 1:</b><br>
    Be  careful  with  Object alignment and  "watch  your STACK". By default
DOS/32  Advanced  DOS Extender will use  PARAgraph alignment (16 bytes) when
loading  Objects  into  extended memory. In  most  cases  this will cause no
trouble  but sometimes you will need to  use larger STACK. It is recommended
that  you  use at least 64KB large  STACK if your program heavily uses local
variables. And just to make sure that everything works as it should it would
not be a bad idea to use 128KB or 256KB stacks.
</font></p>

<p><br></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<b>Advice 2:</b><br>
    When  developing  an  application, turn  on  the Null-Pointer Protection
feature  in  the DOS Extender. It will  help  you locate the accesses to the
uninitialized pointers. Remember that by default the Null-Pointer Protection
feature is disabled.<br><br>
    Also  note  that when the Null-Pointer  Protection is triggered, the DOS
Extender  will  enter the Debug Mode, rather  than  just exit to DOS with an
error  message  as  does  DOS/4GW.  Null-Pointer  Protection  feature is not
available when running under external DPMI (for example Windows) and will be
automatically turned off by the DOS Extender.
</font></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<b>Advice 3:</b><br>
    It  is  recommended  that you use  the  LX-style  executables instead of
LE-style.  They are loaded faster into memory, and occupy less space on disk
(when  Object  Alignment = 0). Use  "-l=dos32x" or "-l=stub32x" options with
<i>wcl386.exe</i>  when  compiling  and  linking  your  programs.  Remember  that
DOS/4G(W)  DOS Extenders are also capable  of loading LX executables, though
it  is  not  documented, so if you  need  to  switch to another DOS Extender
quickly, you will not have to relink you application.<br><br>
    NOTE: the official file format used by DOS/32 Advanced is "LX", starting
with DOS Extender version 4.30. Although the "LE" format is still supported,
you  are highly recommended to use  the LX-style executables for the reasons
mentioned above.
</font></p>

<p><br></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<b>Advice 4:</b><br>
    Although  DOS/32  Advanced is a WATCOM  C/C++ oriented DOS Extender, you
may  use it with other compilers as  long as your applications can be linked
in  "LE" or "LX" formats. The DOS Extender and the built-in DPMI server will
load  and  execute  your  applications  regardless  of  which  compilers  or
development tools you use.<br><br>
    Note that you do not have to use WATCOM libraries and startup code, when
writing  applications for use with DOS/32 Advanced.  But if you do so, going
on  and using your own libraries, you will  not be able to run your programs
under  DOS/4GW  DOS Extender as it is  strictly WATCOM oriented and will not
execute  any  LE/LX programs that  are  not  using WATCOM  startup/libraries
(DOS/4G will work fine though).
</font></p>

<p><br></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<b>Advice 5:</b><br>
    Most  of  DOS/32  Advanced extended API  functions  will not require the
parameters passed in 32-bit registers to be actual 32-bit zero-extended values
as  it  is documented in  "Programmer's Reference" documentation. An example
would  be a DOS API function AH=42h, "Set Current File Position". The actual
parameters passed down to real mode will be 16-bit registers, not 32-bit. Even
though,  it  is recommended that you  use 32-bit zero-extended registers when
using extended API functions because it is much safer and less confusing for
both  the  program and the programmer  himself. Remember that in most cases,
the values returned by the DOS Extender (even selector values) will be 32-bit
zero-extended values.

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<b>Advice 5:</b><br>
    When   running   under  VCPI  and   spawning   several  DOS/32  Advanced
applications  make sure that all of  them have the same memory configuration
(verify  with  SUNSYS Setup Utility).  In  particular, VCPI PageTables, VCPI
PhysTables,  Extended  Memory, VCPI SmartPage  Allocation  Mode and VCPI+XMS
Allocation   Scheme   fields  must  be   configured  equially  for  all  the
applications  that are to be spawned. If  this condition is not met, the DOS
Extender will most likely crash.
