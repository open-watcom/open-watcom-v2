6.0 - DOS/32 Advanced - Known Problems
<br></font></b></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
    This  is  not  a  list of bugs,  rather  than  a list of incompatibility
problems that can arise due to the fact that DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender is
written  and operates in a completely  different way than DOS/4GW. Most of
the  problems  apply to the already  written applications that use DOS/4GW
(very) specific resources.
</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<b>Problem 1:</b><br>
    DOS/32  Advanced built-in DPMI does not support  selector 0020h (nor
any other DOS/4GW specific system selectors), which is used in
DOS/4GW  as  a  system selector. Under  Clean,  XMS  and VCPI systems this
selector  will  be  unavailable to the  applications  and any attempt to load
value 0020h in any of the segment registers in protected mode will result in
a general protection fault exception.<br>
<br>
Known effects/incompatibilies:<br>
The game "Top Gun - Fire at will" does not work.<br>
<br>
Workaround:<br>
None.
</font></p>

<p><br></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<b>Problem 2:</b><br>
    Some  video  BIOSes (for example  Matrox  Mystique/Millenium) return the
list of video modes in the VBE information block (INT 10h function AX=4F00h,
EDI=ptr  to  VBE  info block). This means  that  the pointer in the VBE info
block  at  offset  0Eh, *VideoModePtr, is  relative  to the beginning of the
memory  and  becomes  invalid  if the  structure  is  moved  to other memory
locations.  DOS/32  Advanced is aware of  this and if extended VBE functions
are  called,  will  correctly  translate  the  pointer  to  mode  list  when
transferring  the structure from the buffer in low memory to the destination
location.  However, the structure is then not to be moved unless the user is
manually adjusting the pointer.<br><br>
    This  problem  is  not  specific to  DOS/32  Advanced only and applies to other DOS
Extenders,  such as DOS/4G(W), PMODE/W and CauseWay, which cannot deal with
it correctly.<br>
<br>
Known effects/incompatibilities:<br>
The game "Star Gunner" does not work with VESA modes.<br>
<br>
Workaround:<br>
None.
</font></p>

<p><br></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<b>Problem 3:</b><br>
    When  using  extended  Mouse  functions  (protected  mode  INT 33h) that
install  a custom interrupt handler (functions  0014h, 0018h and so on), the
handler  routine  must return with a RETF  command, not RET or IRETD. DOS/32
Advanced  DOS  Extender strictly follows the  rules  defined in mouse driver
documentation for real mode which are valid in protected mode as well.<br>
<br>
Known effects/incompatibilities:<br>
The game "Dungeon Keeper" does not work.<br>
<br>
Workaround:<br>
None.
</font></p>

<p><br></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<b>Problem 4:</b><br>
    DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender can not correctly load the last Object with
data  placed  behind it when using  LX-style  linear executables. An example
would  be a program linked in LX format with debug information included. The
linker  will place the debug info data  right behind the last Object's data.
This  will, in some cases, mislead the  DOS Extender which will believe that
it  reads the correct number of bytes. That will not be true, of course, and
whatever  would  be in memory after  the last Object's data (most likely the
beginning of the BSS segment) will be corrupted.<br><br>
    Some programs, depending on how they are written, will tolerate this and
the  problem will not show up. However,  this is quite a serious problem and
you  should  consider  using a workaround  when  linking your programs in LX
format with debug info included.<br><br>
    This problem does not apply to  LE/LC-style  executables.  You can place
whatever you want behind the last Object when using those file formats.<br>
<br>
Known effects/incompatibilities:<br>
Since there are  no DOS/4GW programs that use LX-style executables, there are
no incompatibility problems.<br>
<br>
Workaround:<br>
Use WATCOM Linker option "SYMFILE" to place the debugging information outside
your protected mode application. Consider the following example:<br>
<br>
system begin my_program<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;option osname='My Program'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;libpath %WATCOM%\lib386<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;libpath %WATCOM%\lib386\dos<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;debug watcom all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;option stub=stub32a.exe<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;option symfile=myprog<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;option internalrelocs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;format os2 lx<br>
end<br>
<br>
The  linker  will create a file  <i>myprog.sym</i>  containing all the debug info
data,  instead of binding it to your program. You can also use the
"op symfile" line without specifying any file name. Look in your WATCOM docs
for  more  information.  Also look into  <i>dos32a.lnk</i>  file. These lines are
actually there, they are only commented out.

<b>Problem 5:</b><br>
    DOS/32  Advanced built-in DPMI will  create non-standard stack frames on
exceptions. This problem does not affect most applications because they rely
on  system which should normally handle  exceptions. However, if you attempt
to  install  an exception handler using  DPMI functions 0202h and 0203h, you
must  return  from it (if it returns)  using an IRETD instruction, not RETF,
when  running under DOS/32 Advanced ADPMI. You may need to install different
exception  handlers depending on under which system you run: RAW/XMS/VCPI or
DPMI.<br>
<br>
Known effects/incompatibilities:<br>
None of tested programs has suffered from this so far.<br>
<br>
Workaround:<br>
None.<br>
</font></p>

<p><br></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<b>Problem 6:</b><br>
    DOS/32 Advanced does not do automatical pass-up of interrupts other than
INT 08h thru INT 0Fh (ie IRQs 0-7, when PICs are not remapped) as opposed to
DOS/4G(W) Extenders which callback any interrupt hooked in protected mode to
a  protected mode handler in range INT 08h through INT 2Eh.  In other words,
DOS/32  Advanced  will install a real  mode IRQ callback only for interrupts
INT  08-0Fh which are mapped on IRQs 0-7. The interrupts outside this range,
except  for  INTs  70-77h  (IRQs 8-15)  which  are  also  auto-callbacked to
protected  mode,  will not be callbacked  to protected mode when a protected
mode interrupt handler is installed for those.<br><br>
    As  DOS/4GW  DOS  Extender cannot callback  IRQs  of the slave PIC (IRQs
8-15),  some  protected mode programs and  third party libraries, written to
work  exclusively  with  DOS/4GW,  will  workaround  this  by  installing  a
protected mode ISR in DOS/4GW auto-passup range, typically INT 18h, and then
redirect  real mode IRQ vector  of the slave PIC to that interrupt. Whenever
an  IRQ  would  occur  (either in  real  or  protected  modes), DOS/4GW will
typically pass it down to the real mode, where it will be redirected to that
interrupt which is in auto-passup range, which in its turn will callback the
IRQ occurred to the proper interrupt service routine.<br>
<br>
    A  simplier  and  less  technical  explanation  would  be:  if  you  are
experiencing  lockups and/or crashes with a program run under DOS/32A, which
was originally written for DOS/4GW Extender, check that your hardware is not
configured  to  issue IRQs in range 8 thru  15,  and that the program is not
using those hardware interrupts.<br>
<br>
PLEASE NOTE:   this is *NOT* a problem  with  DOS/32 Advanced, rather than a
problem  with  older software which  were  written to workaround DOS/4GW
lack of a fully featured DPMI host.<br>
<br>
Known effects/incompatibilities:<br>
Lockups  at startup of your applications,  blank screen and a message "PRESS
ANY  KEY  TO REBOOT" or computer reboots  all  can be effects caused by this
problem.  Typical  examples of hardware which  can cause this problem are: a
PnP sound cards with IRQ set in range 8-15 and graphics cards (Matrox) which
use IRQ in the same range.<br>
<br>
Workaround:<br>
There  is  no  easy  workaround for  this  problem.  Try  reconfiguring your
hardware  which uses hardware interrupts in range IRQ 8-15. This can be done
quite  easily  on machines with Plug&Play  BIOS,  otherwise you will need to
mess  with jumpers on the card. If  you have a third party libraries written
for  DOS/4GW which cause this problem, contact person/company from which you
obtained  those  to  get an updated  version  which will hopefully solve the
problem. It is also possible that running under an external DPMI server will
solve the problem.

<b>Problem 7:</b><br>
    When  a  DOS/32 Advanced application  that uses "Start Full-Screen under
Windows" feature under  Windows 95/98 exits, the  desktop image and Windows icons
may  appear  to be messed up. This  problem  is related to the graphics card
driver  installed in the system, and has been observed on computers equipped
with ATI, STB and Matrox graphics cards. Apparently this seems to be a bug
in the Windows, not in the DOS Extender.<br>
<br>
Workaround:<br>
Turn  off  "Start Full-Screen under Windows"  feature  by using SUNSYS Setup
Utility,  and  change  application attributes (by  using  PIF Editor) to run
Full-Screen from within Windows.<br>
</font></p>

<p><br></p>

<p><font size=-1 face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<b>Problem 8:</b><br>
    DOS/32  Advanced does not emulate DOS/4G(W) behavior of exclusive volume
locking  under  Windows 95+, which is  required  by programs that use direct
access  to disk drives through interrupts INT  13h, INT 25h, INT 26h and INT
21h  (IOCTL).  Windows 95+ Operating Systems  do  not allow direct access to
disk  drives (for protection reasons) and  require an application to acquire
exclusive  volume  lock on a drive, before  it can directly read or write to
that  drive. This results in that applications which directly write, read or
in  any  other way directly communicate with  disk drives (disk utility
programs such as disk defragmenting and partitioning utilities as well as
some anti-virus programs fall into this category)
 will fail when run
under DOS/32 Advanced in Windows 95+ protected mode environment.<br>
<br>
    As  a  workaround  you can run  applications  that  directly access disk
drives from the real mode DOS (reboot to Win95+ DOS mode). As to the application
developers,   you   are   suggested   to   manually   use   exclusive  volume
locking/unlocking  before using interrupts INT 13h,  INT 25h, INT 26h or INT
21h  (IOCTL)  as needed. Refer to  MSDN articles on exclusive volume locking
(<i>Platform SDK/Windows Base Services/Windows 95 features/Using Windows 95
Features/Exclusive Volume Locking</i>) and description of INT 21h function 440Dh
for further information.
