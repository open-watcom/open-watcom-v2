WMAPCWD Documentation
=====================

The WMAPCWD utility converts a WLINK MAP file into a format that
can be used by the CauseWay debugger CWD.  This process allows
you to see symbolics in your Watcom program when using CWD, if
you do not want to or cannot use the Watcom debugger WD on your
application for whatever reason.

Supply the source (Watcom's WLINK) MAP file and the destination
(CWD-readable) MAP file names as parameters after WMAPCWD.  If
none are supplied WMAPCWD will prompt for them.

Do note that you cannot use the same MAP file name for source
and destination and that CWD will attempt to use the MAP file
name with the base EXE file name.  This means that you must
either rename the Watcom MAP file name prior to the WMAPCWD
process, or force it to a different name than the EXE file using
WLINK's OPTION MAP=<map name> command.

Not much to this utility, but what it does, it does properly.  C
source has been included for those interested or who wish to add
more features and intelligence.
