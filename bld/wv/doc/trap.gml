The &company debugger consists of a number of separate pieces of code.
The main executable, WD.EXE (wd on UNIX systems), provides a debugging
`engine' and user interface.
When the engine wishes to perform an operation upon the program being
debugged such as reading memory or setting a breakpoint, it creates
a request structure and sends it to the `trap file' (so called because
under DOS, it contains the first level trap handlers).
The trap file examines the request structure, performs the indicated action
and returns a result structure to the debugger.
The debugger and trap files also use Machine Architecture Description (MAD)
files which abstract the CPU architecture.
This design has the following benefits:
.autonote
.note
OS debugging interfaces tend to be wildly varying in how they are accessed.
By moving all the OS specific interface code into the trap file and having
a defined interface to access it, porting the debugger becomes much easier.
.note
By abstracting the machine architecture specifics through MAD files, it
becomes possible to use one debugger for several target CPU architectures
(such as x86 and Alpha AXP).
Unlike most other debuggers, the &company debugger is not tied to a single
host/target combination and if appropriate trap and MAD files are available,
the debugger running on any host can remotely debug any target.
.note
The trap file does not have to actually perform the operation.
Instead it could send the request out to a remote server by a communication
link such as a serial line or LAN.
The remote server can retrieve the request, perform the operation on the
remote machine and send the results back via the link.
This enables the debugger to debug applications in cases where there are
memory constraints or other considerations which prevent the debugger proper
from running on the remote system (such as Novell Netware 386).
.endnote
.np
This document describes the interface initially used by version 4.0 of the
WATCOM debugger (shipped with the 10.0 C/C++ and FORTRAN releases).
It has been revised to describe changes incorporated in Watcom 11.0 release,
as well as subsequent Open Watcom releases.
It is expected to be modified in future releases.
Where possible, notification of expected changes are given in the document,
but all aspects are subject to revision.
.*
.section Some Definitions
.*
.np
Next follow some general trap definitions.
.*
.beglevel
.*
.section Byte Order
.*
.np
The trap file interface is defined to use little endian byte order.
That is, the least significant byte is stored at the lowest address.
Little endian byte order was chosen for compatibility with existing trap
files and tools.
Fixed byte order also eases network communication between debuggers and trap
files running on machines with different byte order.
.*
.section Pointer Sizes
.*
.np
In a 16-bit hosted environment such as DOS, all pointers used by the trap file
are "far" 16:16 pointers.
In a 32-bit environment such as Windows NT the pointers are "near" 0:32
pointers.
.*
.section Base Types
.*
.np
A number of basic types are used in the interface.
They are defined as follows:
.begnote
.notehd1 Type
.notehd2 Definition
.note unsigned_8
1 byte unsigned quantity
.note unsigned_16
2 byte unsigned quantity
.note unsigned_32
4 byte unsigned quantity
.note trap_req
The first field of every request is of this type.
It is a 1 byte field which identifies the request to be performed.
.note addr48_ptr
This type encapsulates the concept of a 16:32 pointer.
All addresses in the debuggee memory are described with these.
The debugger always acts as if the debuggee were in a 32-bit large model
environment since the 32-bit flat model and all 16-bit memory models are
subsets.
The structure is defined as follows:
.millust begin
typedef struct {
    unsigned_32    offset;
    unsigned_16    segment;
} addr48_ptr;
.millust end
The
.id segment
field contains the segment of the address and the
.id offset
field stores the offset of the address.
.note bytes
The type bytes is an array of unsigned_8.
The length is provided by other means.
Typically a field of type bytes is the last one in a request and the length
is calculated from the total length of the request.
.note string
The type string is actually an array of characters.
The array is terminated by a null ('\0') character.
The length is provided by other means.
Typically a field of type string is the last one in a request and the length
is calculated from the total length of the request.
.note trap_error
Some trap file requests return debuggee operating system error codes, notably
the requests to perform file I/O on the remote system.
These error codes are returned as an unsigned_32.
The debugger considers the value zero to indicate no error.
.note trap_phandle
This is an unsigned_32 type which holds process (task) handle.
A task handle is used to uniquely identify a debuggee process.
.note trap_mhandle
This is an unsigned_32 type which holds a module handle.
Typically the main executable will be one module, and on systems which support
DLLs or shared libraries, each library will be identified by a unique module
handle.
.endnote
.endlevel
.*
.*
.chap The Request Interface
.*
Next follow detailed description of interface elements.
.*
.section Request Structure
.*
.np
Each request is a composed of two sequences of bytes provided by the
debugger called messages.
The first set contains the actual request code and whatever parameters that
are required by the request.
The second sequence is where the result of the operation is to be stored by
the trap file.
.np
The two sequences need not be contiguous.
The sequences are described to the trap file through two arrays of message
entry structures.
This allows the debugger to avoid unnecessary packing and unpacking of
messages, since
.id mx_entry
can be set to point directly at parameter/result buffers.
.np
Multiple requests are :HP2.not:eHP2. allowed in a single message.
The
.id mx_entry
is only used to provide scatter/gather capabilities for one request at a time.
.np
The message entry structure is as follows (defined in
.id trptypes.h
):
.millust begin
typedef struct {
    void            *ptr;
    unsigned        len;
} mx_entry;
.millust end
.pp
The
.id ptr
is pointing to a block of data for that message entry.
The
.id len
field gives the length of that block.
One array of
.id mx_entry
describes the request message.
The second array describes the return message.
.np
It is not legal to split a message into arbitrary pieces with mx_entries.
Each request documents where an
.id mx_entry
is allowed to start with a line of dashes.
.*
.section The Interface Routines
.*
.np
The trap file interface must provide three routines:
.id TrapInit
,
.id TrapRequest
, and
.id TrapFini
.period
How the debugger determines the address of these routines after loading a trap
file, as well as the calling convention used, is system dependent and
described later.
These functions are prototyped in
.id trpimp.h
.period
.*
.beglevel
.*
.section TrapInit
.*
.np
This function initializes the environment for proper operation of
.id TrapRequest
.period
.millust begin
trap_version TRAPENTRY TrapInit(
    char       *parm,
    char       *error,
    unsigned_8 remote
);
.millust end
.pp
The
.id parm
is a string that the user passes to the trap file.
Its interpretation is completely up to the trap file.
In the case of the &company debugger, all the characters following
the semicolon in the
.id /TRAP
option are passed as the
.id parm
.period
For example:
.millust begin
wd /trap=nov;testing program
.millust end
.np
The
.id parm
would be "testing".
Any error message will be returned in
.id error
.period
The
.id remote
field is a zero if the &company debugger is loading the trap file and a one
if a remote server is loading it.
This function returns a structure
.id trap_version
of the following form
(defined in
.id trptypes.h
):
.millust begin
typedef struct {
    unsigned_8  major;
    unsigned_8  minor;
    unsigned_8  remote;
} trap_version;
.millust end
.pp
The
.id major
field contains the major version number of the trap file while the
.id minor
field tells the minor version number of the trap file.
.id Major
is changed whenever there is a modification made to the trap file
that is not upwardly compatable with previous versions.
.id Minor
increments by one whenever a change is made to the trap file that is upwardly
compatible with previous versions.
The current major verion is &trp_majver., the current minor version is &trp_minver..
The
.id remote
field informs the
debugger whether the trap file communicates with a remote machine.
.np
.id TrapInit
must be called before using
.id TrapRequest
to send a request.
Failure to do so may result in unpredictable operation of
.id TrapRequest
.period
.*
.section TrapRequest
.*
.np
All requests between the server and the remote trap file are handled by
TrapRequest.
.millust begin
unsigned TRAPENTRY TrapRequest(
    unsigned num_in_mx,
    mx_entry *mx_in,
    unsigned num_out_mx,
    mx_entry *mx_out
);
.millust end
.pp
The
.id mx_in
points to an array of request mx_entry's.
The
.id num_in_mx
field contains the number of elements of the array.
Similarly, the
.id mx_out
will point to an array of return mx_entry's.
The number of elements will be given by the
.id num_out_mx
field.
The total number of bytes actually filled in to the return message by the trap
file is returned by the function (this may be less than the total number of
bytes described by the
.id mx_out
array).
.np
Since every request must start with an
.id trap_req
field, the minimum size of a request message is one byte.
.np
Some requests do not require a return message.
In this case, the program invoking TrapRequest :HP2.must:eHP2. pass zero for
.id num_out_mx
and NULL for
.id mx_out
.period
.*
.beglevel
.*
.section Request Example
.*
.np
The request REQ_READ_MEM needs the memory address and length
of memory to read as input and will return the memory block in the
output message.
To read 30 bytes of memory from address 0x0010:0x8000 into a buffer, we can
write:
.millust begin
mx_entry        in[1];
mx_entry        out[1];
unsigned char   buffer[30];
struct in_msg_def {
    trap_req            req;
    addr48_ptr          addr;
    unsigned_16         len;
} in_msg = { REQ_READ_MEM, { 0x8000, 0x0010 }, sizeof( buffer ) };

unsigned_16 mem_blk_len;

in[0].ptr = &in_msg;
in[0].len = sizeof( in_msg );
out[0].ptr = &buffer;
out[0].len = sizeof( buffer );

mem_blk_len = TrapRequest( 1, in, 1, out );

if( mem_blk_length != sizeof( buffer ) ) {
    printf( "Error in reading memory\n" );
} else {
    printf( "OK\n" );
}
.millust end
.pp
The program will print "OK" if it has transferred 30 bytes of data from the
debuggee's address space to the
.id buffer
variable.
If less than 30 bytes is transfered, an error message is printed out.
.endlevel
.*
.*
.section TrapFini
.*
.np
The function terminates the link between the debugger and the trap file.
It should be called
after finishing all access requests.
.millust begin
void TRAPENTRY TrapFini( void );
.millust end
.pp
After calling
.id TrapFini
, it is illegal to call
.id TrapRequest
without calling
.id TrapInit
again.
.endlevel
.*
.*
.chap The Requests
.*
This section descibes the individual requests, their parameters, and
their return values.
A line of dashes indicates where an
.id mx_entry
is allowed (but not required) to start.
The debugger allows
(via REQ_GET_SUPPLEMENTARY_SERVICE/REQ_PERFORM_SUPPLEMENTARY_SERVICE) optional
components to be implemented only on specific systems.
.np
The numeric value of the request which is placed in the
.id req
field follows the symbolic name in parentheses.
.*
.section Core Requests
.*
.np
These requests need to be implemented in all versions of the trap file,
although some of them may only be stub implementations in some environments.
Note that structures suitable for individual requests are declared in
.id trpcore.h
.period
.*
.beglevel
.*
.section REQ_CONNECT
.*
.np
Request to connect to the remote machine.
This must be the first request made.
.np
Request message:
.millust begin
trap_req        req
unsigned_8      major;   <-+- struct trap_version
unsigned_8      minor;     |
unsigned_8      remote;  <-+
.millust end
.pp
The
.id req
field contains the request.
The
.id trap_version
structure tells the version of the program making the request.
The
.id major
field contains the major version number of the trap file while the
.id minor
field tells the minor version number of the trap file.
The
.id major
is changed whenever there is a modification made to the trap file that is not
upwardly compatable with previous versions.
The
.id minor
increments by one whenever a change is made to the trap file that is upwardly
compatable with previous versions.
The current major version is &trp_majver., the current minor version is
&trp_minver..
The
.id remote
field informs the trap file whether a remote server is between the &company
debugger and the trap file.
.np
Return message:
.millust begin
unsigned_16 max_msg_size
----------------------------
string      err_msg
.millust end
.pp
If error has occurred, the
.id err_msg
field will returns the error message string.
If there is no error,
.id error_msg
returns a null character and the field
.id max_msg_size
will contain the allowed maximum size of a message in bytes.
Any message (typically reading/writing memory or files)
which would require more than the maximum number of bytes
to transmit or receive must be broken up into multiple requests.
The minimum acceptable value for this
field is 256.
.*
.section REQ_DISCONNECT
.*
.np
Request to terminate the link between the local and remote machine.
After this request, a REQ_CONNECT must be the next one made.
.np
Request message:
.millust begin
trap_req        req
.millust end
.pp
The
.id req
field contains the request.
.np
Return message:
.millust begin
NONE
.millust end
.*
.section REQ_SUSPEND
.*
.np
Request to suspend the link between the server and the remote trap file.
The debugger issues this message just before it spawns a sub-shell (the
"system" command).
This allows a remote server to enter a state where it allows other trap files
to connect to it (normally, once a remote server has connected to a trap file,
the remote link will fail any other attempts to connect to it).
This allows the user for instance to start up an RFX process and transfer any
missing files to the remote machine before continuing the debugging process.
.np
Request message:
.millust begin
trap_req        req
.millust end
.pp
The
.id req
field contains the request.
.np
Return message:
.millust begin
NONE
.millust end
.*
.section REQ_RESUME
.*
.np
Request to resume the link between the server and the remote trap file.
The debugger issues this request when the spawned sub-shell exits.
.np
Request message:
.millust begin
trap_req        req
.millust end
.pp
The
.id req
field contains the request.
.np
Return message:
.millust begin
NONE
.millust end
.*
.section REQ_GET_SUPPLEMENTARY_SERVICE
.*
.np
Request to obtain a supplementary service id.
.np
Request message:
.millust begin
trap_req    req
------------------------
string      service_name
.millust end
.pp
The
.id req
field contains the request.
The
.id service_name
field contains a string identifying the supplementary service.
This string is case insensitive.
.np
Return message:
.millust begin
trap_error      err;
trap_shandle    id;
.millust end
.pp
The
err
field is non-zero if something went wrong in obtaining
or initializing the service.
.id Id
is the identifier for a particular supplementary service.
It need not be the same from one invocation of the trap file to another.
If both it and the
.id err
field are zero, it means that the
service is not available from this trap file.
:NOTE. In the future, we might allow for user developed add-ons to be
integrated with the debugger.
There would be two components, one to be added to the debugger and one
to be added to the trap file.
The two pieces could communicate with each other via the supplementary
services mechanism.
.*
.section REQ_PERFORM_SUPPLEMENTARY_SERVICE
.*
.np
Request to perform a supplementary service.
.np
Request message:
.millust begin
trap_req    req
unsigned_32 service_id
------------------------
unspecified
.millust end
.pp
The
.id req
field contains the request.
The
.id service_id
field indicates which service is being requested.
The remainder of the request is specified by the individual supplementary
service provider.
.np
Return message:
.millust begin
unspecified
.millust end
.pp
The return message is specified by the individual supplementary service
provider.
.*
.section REQ_GET_SYS_CONFIG
.*
.np
Request to get system information from the remote machine.
.np
Request message:
.millust begin
trap_req        req
.millust end
.pp
The
.id req
field contains the request.
.np
Return message:
.millust begin
unsigned_8  cpu;
unsigned_8  fpu;
unsigned_8  osmajor;
unsigned_8  osminor;
unsigned_8  os;
unsigned_8  huge_shift;
unsigned_8  arch;
.millust end
.pp
The
.id arch
field specifies the architecture in use and
determines how the other fields will be interpreted.
Currently the following architectures are used:
.millust begin
DIG_ARCH_X86  - Intel Architecture IA-32 compatible
DIG_ARCH_X64  - Intel Architecture X64 compatible
DIG_ARCH_AXP  - Alpha Architecture
DIG_ARCH_PPC  - PowerPC Architecture
DIG_ARCH_MIPS - MIPS Architecture
DIG_ARCH_MSJ  - Java Virtual Machine (Microsoft)
DIG_ARCH_JVM  - Java Virtual Machine (Sun)
.millust end
.pp
The
.id cpu
fields returns the type of the remote CPU.
The size of that field is unsigned_8.
Possible CPU types for DIG_ARCH_X86 are:
.millust begin
bits 0-3
   X86_86  = 0   - 8086
   X86_186 = 1   - 80186
   X86_286 = 2   - 80286
   X86_386 = 3   - 80386
   X86_486 = 4   - 80486
   X86_586 = 5   - Pentium
   X86_686 = 6   - Pentium Pro/II/III
   X86_P4  = 15  - Pentium 4
bit  4           - MMX registers
bit  5           - XMM registers
bits 6           - unused
bits 7           - unused
.millust end
.pp
The
.id fpu
fields tells the type of FPU.
The size of the field is unsigned_8.
FPU types for DIG_ARCH_X86 include:
.millust begin
X86_NOFPU =  0   - No FPU
X86_87    =  1   - 8087
X86_287   =  2   - 80287
X86_387   =  3   - 80387
X86_487   =  4   - 486 integrated FPU
X86_587   =  5   - Pentium integrated FPU
X86_687   =  6   - Pentium Pro/II/III integrated FPU
X86_P47   =  15  - Pentium 4 integrated FPU
X86_EMU   = 255  - Software emulated FPU
.millust end
.pp
The
.id osmajor
and
.id osminor
contains the major and minor version number for the operating system of the
remote machine.
The type of operating system can be found in
.id os
field.
The size of this field is unsigned_8.
The OS can be:
.millust begin
DIG_OS_IDUNNO    =  0   - Unknown operating system
DIG_OS_DOS       =  1   - DOS
DIG_OS_OS2       =  2   - OS/2
DIG_OS_PHAR      =  3   - Phar Lap 386 DOS Extender
DIG_OS_ECLIPSE   =  4   - Eclipse 386 DOS Extender (obsolete)
DIG_OS_NW386     =  5   - NetWare 386
DIG_OS_QNX       =  6   - QNX 4.x
DIG_OS_RATIONAL  =  7   - DOS/4G or compatible
DIG_OS_WINDOWS   =  8   - Windows 3.x
DIG_OS_PENPOINT  =  9   - PenPoint (obsolete)
DIG_OS_NT        = 10   - Win32
DIG_OS_AUTOCAD   = 11   - ADS/ADI development (obsolete)
DIG_OS_NEUTRINO  = 12   - QNX 6.x
DIG_OS_LINUX     = 13   - Linux
DIG_OS_FREEBSD   = 14   - FreeBSD
DIG_OS_WIN64     = 15   - Windows 64-bit
.millust end
.pp
The
.id huge_shift
field is used to determine the shift needed for huge arithmetic in that system.
It stores the number of left shifts required in order to calculate the next
segment correctly.
It is 12 for real mode programs.
The value in a protect mode environment must be obtained from the OS of the
debuggee machine.
This field is only relevant for 16-bit segmented architectures.
.*
.section REQ_MAP_ADDR
.*
.np
Request to map the input address to the actual address of the remote machine.
The addresses in the symbolic information provided by the linker do not
reflect any relocation performed on the executable by the system loader.
This request obtains that relocation information so that the debugger can
update its addresses.
.np
Request message:
.millust begin
trap_req        req;
addr48_ptr      in_addr;
trap_mhandle    mod_handle;
.millust end
.pp
The
.id req
field contains the request.
The
.id in_addr
tells the address to map.
The
.id mod_handle
field identifies the module which the address is from.
The value from this field is obtained by REQ_PROG_LOAD or REQ_GET_LIB_NAME.
There are two magical values for the
.id in_addr.segment
field.
.millust begin
MAP_FLAT_CODE_SELECTOR  = -1
MAP_FLAT_DATA_SELECTOR  = -2
.millust end
.pp
When the
.id in_addr.segment
equals one of these values, the debugger does not have a map segment value
and is requesting that the trap file performs the mapping as if the given
offset was in the flat address space.
.np
Return message:
.millust begin
addr48_ptr      out_addr
addr48_off      lo_bound;
addr48_off      hi_bound;
.millust end
.pp
The mapped address is returned in
.id out_addr
.period
Note that in addition to the segment portion being modified, the offset of
the portion of the address may be adjusted as well if the loader performs
offset relocations (like OS/2 2.x or Windows NT).
The
.id lo_bound
and
.id hi_bound
fields identify the lowest and highest input offsets for which this mapping
is valid.
If the debugger needs to map another address whose input segment value
is the same as a previous request, and the input offset falls within the
valid range identified by the return of that previous request, it can
perform the mapping itself and not bother sending the request to the trap
file.
.*
.section REQ_CHECKSUM_MEM
.*
.np
Request to calculate the checksum for a block of memory in the debuggee's
address space.
This is used by the debugger to determine if the contents of the memory block
have changed since the last time it was read.
Since only a four byte checksum has to be transmitted back, it is more
efficient than actually reading the memory again.
The debugger does not care how the checksum is calculated.
.np
Request message:
.millust begin
trap_req        req;
addr48_ptr      in_addr;
unsigned_16     len;
.millust end
.pp
The
.id req
field stores the request.
The
.id in_addr
contains the starting address and the
.id len
field tells how large the block of memory is.
.np
Return message:
.millust begin
unsigned_32     result
.millust end
.pp
The checksum will be returned in
.id result
.period
.*
.section REQ_READ_MEM
.*
.np
Request to read a block of memory.
.np
Request message:
.millust begin
trap_req        req;
addr48_ptr      mem_addr;
unsigned_16     len;
.millust end
.pp
The
.id mem_addr
contains the address of the memory block to read from the remote machine.
The length of the block is determined by
.id len
.period
The memory data will be copied to output message.
.np
Return message:
.millust begin
bytes       data
.millust end
.pp
The
.id data
field stores the memory block read in.
The length of this memory block is given by the return value from TrapRequest.
If error has occurred in reading memory, the length of the data returns will
not be equal to the number of bytes requested.
.*
.section REQ_WRITE_MEM
.*
.np
Request to write a block of memory.
.np
Request message:
.millust begin
trap_req        req
addr48_ptr      mem_addr
------------------------
bytes           data
.millust end
.pp
The
.id data
field stores the memory data to be transferred.
The data will be stored in the debuggee's address space starting at
the address in the
.id mem_addr
field.
.np
Return message:
.millust begin
unsigned_16 len
.millust end
.pp
The
.id len
field tells the length of memory block actually written to the debuggee
machine.
If error has occurred in writing the memory, the length returned will not be
equal to the number of bytes requested.
.*
.section REQ_READ_IO
.*
.np
Request to read data from I/O address space of the debuggee.
.np
Request message:
.millust begin
trap_req        req
unsigned_32     IO_offset
unsigned_8      len
.millust end
.pp
The
.id IO_offset
contains the I/O address of the debuggee machine.
The length of the block is determined by
.id len
.period
It must be 1, 2 or 4 bytes.
The data will be copied from
.id IO_offset
to the return message.
.np
Return message:
.millust begin
bytes       data
.millust end
.pp
The
.id data
field stores the memory block read in.
The length of this memory block is given by the return value from TrapRequest.
If an error has occurred in reading, the length returned will not be equal to
the number of bytes requested.
.*
.section REQ_WRITE_IO
.*
.np
Request to write data to the I/O address space of the debuggee.
.np
Request message:
.millust begin
trap_req        req
unsigned_32     IO_offset
-------------------------
bytes           data
.millust end
.pp
The
.id IO_offset
contains the I/O address of the debuggee machine.
The data stored in
.id data
field will be copied to
.id IO_offset
on the debuggee machine.
.np
Return message:
.millust begin
unsigned_8  len

.pp
The
.id len
field tells the number of bytes actually written out.
If an error has occurred in writing, the length returned will not be equal
to the number of bytes requested.
.*
.section REQ_PROG_GO/REQ_PROG_STEP
.*
.np
Requests to execute the debuggee.
REQ_PROG_GO causes the debuggee to resume execution, while REQ_PROG_STEP
requests only a single machine instruction to be executed before returning.
In either case, this request will return when a breakpoint, watchpoint,
machine exception or other significant event has been encountered.
While executing, a trap file is allowed to return spurious COND_WATCH
indications.
The debugger always checks its own watchpoint table for changes before
reporting to the user.
This means that a legal implementation of a trap file (but :HP2.very:eHP2.
inefficient) can just single step the program and return COND_WATCH for every
instruction when there are active watchpoints present.
.np
Request message:
.millust begin
trap_req        req
.millust end
.pp
The request is in
.id req
field.
.np
Return message:
.millust begin
addr48_ptr      stack_pointer
addr48_ptr      program_counter
unsigned_16     conditions
.millust end
.pp
The
.id stack_pointer
and
.id program_counter
fields store the latest values of SS:ESP and CS:EIP (or their non-x86
equivalents) respectively.
The
.id conditions
informs the debugger what conditions have changed since execution began.
It contains the following flags:
.millust begin
Bit 0   : COND_CONFIG           - Configurations change
Bit 1   : COND_SECTIONS         - Program overlays change
Bit 2   : COND_LIBRARIES        - Libraries (DLL) change
Bit 3   : COND_ALIASING         - Alias change
Bit 4   : COND_THREAD           - Thread change
Bit 5   : COND_THREAD_EXTRA     - Thread extra change
Bit 6   : COND_TRACE            - Trace point occurred
Bit 7   : COND_BREAK            - Break point occurred
Bit 8   : COND_WATCH            - Watch point occurred
Bit 9   : COND_USER             - User interrupt
Bit 10  : COND_TERMINATE        - Program terminated
Bit 11  : COND_EXCEPTION        - Machine exception
Bit 12  : COND_MESSAGE          - Message to be displayed
Bit 13  : COND_STOP             - Debuggee wants to stop
Bit 14  : COND_RUNNING          - Debuggee is running
Bit 15  : not used
.millust end
When a bit is off, the debugger avoids having to make additional requests
to determine the new state of the debuggee.
If the trap file is not sure that a particular item has changed, or if it is
expensive to find out, it should just turn the bit on.
.*

For example, under QNX, the PATH environment variable is searched for the
DIG_FILETYPE_EXE type, and the WD_PATH environment variable is searched for the others.
The
.id file_name
field contains the file name to be converted.
.np
Return message:
.millust begin
trap_error      err
--------------------------

.millust end
.pp
If no error occurs the
.id err
field returns a zero and the full path name will be stored in the
.id path_name
field.
When an error has occurred, the
.id err
field contains an error code indicating the type of error that has been
detected.

.section Overlay requests
.*
.np
This section describes requests that deal with overlays (supported
only under 16-bit DOS).
These requests are actually performed by the
core request REQ_PERFORM_SUPPLEMENTARY_SERVICE and appropriate service ID.
The following descriptions do not show that "prefix" to the
request messages.
.np
The service name to be used in the REQ_GET_SUPPLEMENTARY_SERVICE is
"Overlays".
.np
The overlay requests use a new basic type in addition to the ones already
described:
.begnote
.notehd1 Type
.notehd2 Definition
.note addr32_ptr
This type encapsulates the concept of a 16:16 pointer into the debuggee's
address space.
Since overlays are only useful for 16-bit environments, using the addr48_ptr
type would be inefficient.
The structure is defined as follows:
.millust begin
typedef struct {
    unsigned_16    offset;
    unsigned_16    segment;
} addr32_ptr;
.millust end
The
.id segment
field contains the segment of the address and the
.id offset
field stores the offset of the address.
.note ovl_address
This type contains the overlay address and
the number of entries down in the overlay stack.
The structure is defined as follows:
.millust begin
typedef struct {
    addr32_ptr  mach;
    unsigned_16 sect_id;
} ovl_address;
.millust end
The
.id mach

.chap System Dependent Aspects
.*
Every environment has a different method of loading the code for the trap
file and locating the TrapInit, TrapRequest, and TrapFini routines.
This section descibes how the &company debugger performs these operations
for the various systems.
.*
.section Trap Files Under DOS
.*
.np
A trap file is an "EXE" format file with the extension ".TRP".
The debugger searches the directories specified by the PATH
environment variable.
Once found, it is loaded into memory and has the normal EXE style relocations
applied to the image.
Then the lowest address in the load image (NOTE: not the starting address
from EXE header information) is examined for the following structure:
.millust begin
typedef struct {
    unsigned_16     signature; /* == 0xDEAF */
    unsigned_16     init_off;
    unsigned_16     acc_off;
    unsigned_16     fini_off;
} trap_header;
.millust end
.pp
If the first 2 bytes contain the value 0xDEAF, the file is considered to
be a valid trap file and the
.id init_off
,
.id acc_off
, and
.id fini_off
fields are used to obtain the offsets of the TrapInit, TrapRequest, and
TrapFini routines repectively.
.np
The starting address field of the EXE header should be set to point at
some code which prints out a message about not being able to be run from
the command line and then terminates.
.*
.section Trap Files Under OS/2
.*
.np
A trap file is a normal OS/2 DLL.
The system automatically searches the directories specified by the LIBPATH
command in the CONFIG.SYS file.
Once loaded, the &company debugger uses export ordinal 1 from the DLL for
TrapInit, export ordinal 2 for TrapFini and export ordinal 3 for TrapRequest.
Some example code follows:
.millust begin
rc = DosLoadModule( NULL, 0, trap_file_name, &dll_module );
if( rc != 0 ) {
    return( "unable to load trap file" );
}
if( DosGetProcAddr( dll_module, "#1", &TrapInit ) != 0
 || DosGetProcAddr( dll_module, "#2", &TrapFini ) != 0
 || DosGetProcAddr( dll_module, "#3", &TrapRequest ) != 0 ) {
    return( "incorrect version of trap file" );
}
.millust end
.*
.section Trap Files Under Windows.
.*
.np
A trap file is a normal Windows DLL.
The system automatically searches the directories specified by the PATH
environment variable.
Once loaded, the &company debugger uses export ordinal 2 from the DLL for
TrapInit, export ordinal 3 for TrapFini and export ordinal 4 for TrapRequest.
Some example code follows:
.millust begin
dll = LoadLibrary( trap_file_name );
if( dll < 32 ) {
    return( "unable to load trap file" );
}
TrapInit   = (LPVOID) GetProcAddress( dll, (LPSTR)2 );
TrapFini   = (LPVOID) GetProcAddress( dll, (LPSTR)3 );
TrapRequest = (LPVOID) GetProcAddress( dll, (LPSTR)4 );
if( TrapInit == NULL || TrapFini == NULL || TrapRequest == NULL ) {
    return( "incorrect version of trap file" );
}
.millust end
.*
.section Trap Files Under Windows NT.
.*
.np
A trap file is a normal Windows NT DLL.
The system automatically searches the directories specified by the PATH
environment variable.
Once loaded, the &company debugger uses export ordinal 1 from the DLL for
TrapInit, export ordinal 2 for TrapFini and export ordinal 3 for TrapRequest.
Some example code follows:
.millust begin
dll = LoadLibrary( trap_file_name );
if( dll < 32 ) {
    return( "unable to load trap file" );
}
TrapInit   = (LPVOID) GetProcAddress( dll, (LPSTR)1 );
TrapFini   = (LPVOID) GetProcAddress( dll, (LPSTR)2 );
TrapRequest = (LPVOID) GetProcAddress( dll, (LPSTR)3 );
if( TrapInit == NULL || TrapFini == NULL || TrapRequest == NULL ) {
    return( "incorrect version of trap file" );
}
.millust end
.*
.section Trap Files Under QNX
.*
.np
A trap file is a QNX load module format file with the extension ".trp"
and whose file permissions are not marked as executable.
The debugger searches the directories specified by the WD_PATH environment
variable and then the "/usr/watcom/wd" directory.
Once found, it is loaded into memory and has the normal loader relocations
applied to the image.
Then the lowest address in the load image (NOTE: not the starting address
from load module header information) is examined for the following structure:
.millust begin
typedef struct {
    unsigned_16     signature; /* == 0xDEAF */
    unsigned_16     init_off;
    unsigned_16     acc_off;
    unsigned_16     fini_off;
} trap_header;
.millust end
.pp
If the first 2 bytes contain the value 0xDEAF, the file is considered to
be a valid trap file and the
.id init_off
,
.id acc_off
, and
.id fini_off
fields are used to obtain the offsets of the TrapInit, TrapRequest, and
TrapFini routines repectively.
.np
The starting address field of the load image header should be set to point at
some code which prints out a message about not being able to be run from
the command line and then terminates.
.*
.section Trap Files Under Netware 386 or PenPoint
.*
.np
The trap file routines are linked directly into the remote server code and
TrapInit, TrapRequest, TrapFini are directly called.
