* Description:  Special access routines spliced into the debuggee.
*
****************************************************************************/

/****************************************************************************

 A bit of explanation is needed here. This is a gross hack. But a necessary
 hack - allowing us to circumvent certain limitations of the OS/2 debugging
 interface as well as add nifty features to the debugger.

 Example: It is not possible to read the TIB (pointed to by debuggee's FS:0)
 through DosDebug. Yet the ability to read this data is extremely helpful
 when debugging exception handling, figuring out stack limits and the like.
 So what do we do? Splice a chunk of code into the debuggee's address space.
 When we need to perform special order access, we save debuggee's registers,
 point ESP to special stack, point EIP to our routine and resume execution.
 The routine will hit a breakpoint when it's done, at which point the
 debugger will restore all registers. Not pretty but works.

 This mechanism also gives us ability to do things like redirect debuggee's
 file handles, print on its screen and the like.

 Implementation: To perform these feats of magic, we force load a helper DLL
 in debuggee's context. We have a simple routine that does that defined here.
 We copy it into the debuggee and run it there. We also load the DLL in this
 trap file. Due to the way DLLs are implemented on OS/2, we know that the
 addresses of routines in the DLL mapped in the debuggee will be identical
 to addresses that we see in the debugger context (because the trap file
 and the debuggee always run on the same machine).
