<TITLE>CONFIDENTIAL - WATCOM 386 Code Generator Interface
</TITLE>
<BODY>
<H1>General</H1>
<P>The code generator (back end) interface is a set of procedure calls.
These are divided into Code Generation (CG), Data Generation (DG),
miscellaneous Back End (BE), Front end supplied (FE), and debugger
information (DB) routines.
<H2>cg_init_info BEInit( cg_switches switches, cg_target_switches targ_switches, uint optsize, proc_revision proc )</H2>
<! BEInit
<P>Initialize the code generator.
This must be the first routine to be called.
<DL>
<DT><b><i>Parameter</i></b>
<DD><b><i>Definition</i></b>
<DT>switches
<DD>Select code generation options.
The options are bits, so may be combined with the bit-wise operator |.
Options apply to the entire compilation unit.
The bit values are defined below.
<DT>targ_switches
<DD>Target specific switches.
The bit values are defined below.
<DT>optsize
<DD>A number between 0 and 100.
0 means optimize for speed, 100 means optimize for size.
Anything in between selects a compromise between speed and size.
<DT>proc
<DD>The target hardware configuration, defined below.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>Returns
<DD>Information about the code generator revision in a cg_init_info
structure, defined below.
</DL>
<DL>
<! options
<DT><b><i>Switch</i></b>
<DD><b><i>Definition</i></b>
<DT>NO_OPTIMIZATION
<DD>Turn off optimizations.
<DT>NUMBERS
<DD>Generate line number debugging information.
<DT>FORTRAN_ALIASING
<DD>Assume pointers are only used for parameter passing.
<DT>RELAX_ALIAS
<DD>Assume that a static/extern variable and a pointer to that same
variable are not used within the same routine.
<DT>DBG_LOCALS
<DD>Generate local symbol information for use by the WATCOM debugger.
<DT>DBG_TYPES
<DD>Generate typing information for use by the WATCOM debugger.
<DT>LOOP_OPTIMIZATION
<DD>Turn on loop optimizations.
<DT>INS_SCHEDULING
<DD>Turn on instruction scheduling.
<DT>MEMORY_LOW_FAILS
<DD>Allow the code generator to run out of memory without being able to
generate object code (allows the 386 compiler to use EBP as a cache
register).
<DT>FP_UNSTABLE_OPTIMIZATION
<DD>Allow the code generator to perform optimizations that are
mathematically correct, but are numerically unstable.
E.g.
converting division by a constant to a multiplication by the reciprocal.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><b><i>x86 Switch</i></b>
<DD><b><i>Definition</i></b>
<DT>I_MATH_INLINE
<DD>Do not check arguments for operators like O_SQRT.
This allows the compiler to use some specialty x87 instructions.
<DT>EZ_OMF
<DD>Generate Phar Lap EZ-OMF object files.
<DT>BIG_DATA
<DD>Use segmented pointers (16:16 or 16:32).
This defines T_POINTER to be equivalent to T_HUGE_POINTER.
<DT>BIG_CODE
<DD>Use inter segment (far) call and return instructions.
<DT>CHEAP_POINTER
<DD>Assume far objects are addressable by one segment value.
This must be used in conjunction with BIG_DATA.
It defines T_POINTER to be equivalent to T_FAR_POINTER.
<DT>FLAT_MODEL
<DD>Assume all segment registers address the same base memory.
<DT>FLOATING_FS
<DD>Does FS float (or is it pegged to DGROUP).
<DT>FLOATING_GS
<DD>Does GS float (or is it pegged to DGROUP).
<DT>FLOATING_ES
<DD>Does ES float (or is it pegged to DGROUP).
<DT>FLOATING_SS
<DD>Does SS float (or is it pegged to DGROUP).
<DT>FLOATING_DS
<DD>Does DS float (or is it pegged to DGROUP).
<DT>USE_32
<DD>Generate code into a use32 segment (versus use16).
<DT>INDEXED_GLOBALS
<DD>Generate all global and static variable references as an offset
past EBX.
<DT>WINDOWS
<DD>Generate windows prolog/epilog sequences for all routines.
<DT>CHEAP_WINDOWS
<DD>Generate windows prolog/epilog sequences assuming that call backs
functions are defined as __export.
<DT>NO_CALL_RET_TRANSFORM
<DD>Do not change a CALL followed by a RET into a JMP.
This is used for some older overlay managers that cannot handle a JMP
to an overlay.
<DT>CONST_IN_CODE
<DD>Generate all constant data into the code segment.
This only applies to the internal code generator data, such as floating
point constants.
The front end decides where its data goes using BESetSeg().
<DT>NEED_STACK_FRAME
<DD>Generate a traceable stack frame.
The first instructions will be <B>INC BP</B> if the routine uses a
far return instruction, followed by <B>PUSH BP</B> and <B>MOV
BP,SP</B>.
(ESP and EBP for 386 targets).

</PRE>
<H2>void BEStart()</H2>
<! BEStart
<P>Start the code generator.
Must be called immediately after all calls to BEDefSeg have been made.
This restriction is relaxed somewhat for the 80(x)86 code generator.
See BEDefSeg for details.
<H2>void BEStop()</H2>
<! BEStop
<P>Normal termination of code generator.
This must be the second last routine called.
<H2>void BEAbort()</H2>

<P>Abnormal termination of code generator.
This must be the second last routine called.
<H2>void BEFini()</H2>
<! BEFini
<P>Finalize the code generator.
This must be the last routine called.
<H2>extern patch_handle BEPatch()</H2>
<P>Allocate a patch handle which can be used to create a patchable
integer (an integer which will have a constant value provided sometime
while the codegen is handling the CGDone call).
See CGPatchNode.
<H2>extern void BEPatchInteger( patch_handle hdl, signed_32 value )</H2>
<P>Patch the integer corresponding to the given handle to have the
given value.
This may be called repeatedly with different values, providing
CGPatchNode has been called and BEFiniPatch has not been called.
<DL>
<DT><b><i>Parameter</i></b>
<DD><b><i>Definition</i></b>
<DT>hdl
<DD>A patch_handle returned from an earlier invocation of BEPatch which
has had a node allocated for it via CGPatchNode.
If CGPatchNode has not been called with the handle given, the behaviour
is undefined.
<DT>value
<DD>A signed 32-bit integer value.
This will be the new value of the node which has been associated with
the patch handle.
</DL>
<H2>extern cg_name BEFiniPatch( patch_handle hdl )</H2>
<P>This must be called to free up resources used by the given handle.
After this, the handle must not be used again.
<H1>Segments</H1>
<P>The object file produced by the code generator is composed of
various segments.
These are defined by the front end.
A program may have as many data and code segments as required by the
front end.
Each segment may be regarded as an individual file of objects, and may
be created simultaneously.
There is a current segment, selected by BESetSeg(), into which all DG
routines generate their data.
The code for each routine is generated into the segment returned by the
FESegID() call when it is passed the cg_sym_handle for the routine.
It is illegal to write data to the code segment for a routine in
between the CGProcDecl call and the CGReturn call.
<P>The following routines are used for initializing, finalizing,
defining and selecting segments.
<H2>void BEDefSeg( segment_id id, seg_attr attr, char *str, uint algn )</H2>
<! BEDefSeg
<! segments
<P>Define a segment.
This must be called after BEInit and before BEStart.
For the 80(x)86 code generator, you are allowed to define additional
segments after BEStart if they are:
<OL>
<LI>Code Segments
<LI>PRIVATE data segments.
</OL>
<DL>
<DT><b><i>Parameter</i></b>
<DD><b><i>Definition</i></b>
<DT>id
<DD>A non-negative integer used as an identifier for the segment.
It is arbitrarily picked by the front end.
<DT>attr
<DD>Segment attribute bits, defined below.
<DT>str
<DD>The name given to the segment.
<DT>algn
<DD>The segment alignment requirements.
The code generator will pick the next larger alignment allowed by the
object module format.
For example, 9 would select paragraph alignment.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><b><i>Attribute</i></b>
<DD><b><i>Definition</i></b>
<DT>EXEC
<DD>This is a code segment.
<DT>GLOBAL
<DD>The segment is accessible to other modules.
(versus PRIVATE).
<DT>INIT
<DD>The segment is statically initialized.
<DT>ROM
<DD>The segment is read only.
<DT>BACK
<DD>The code generator may put its data here.
One segment must be marked with this attribute.
It may not be a COMMON, PRIVATE or EXEC segment.
If the front end requires code in the EXEC segment, the CONST_IN_CODE
switch must be passed to BEInit().
<DT>COMMON
<DD>All occurrences of this segment will be overlayed.
This is used for FORTRAN common blocks.
<DT>PRIVATE
<DD>The segment is non combinable.
This is used for far data items.
<DT>GIVEN_NAME
<DD>Normally, the back end feels free to prepend or append strings to
the segment name passed in by the front end.
This allows a naive front end to specify a constant set of segment
names, and have the code generator mangle them in such a manner that
they work properly in concert with the set of cg_switches that have
been specified (e.g.
prepending the module name to the code segments when BIG_CODE is
specified on the x86).
When GIVEN_NAME is specified, the back end outputs the segment name to
the object file exactly as given.
</DL>
<H2>segment_id BESetSeg( segment_id seg )</H2>
<! BESetSeg
<! segments
<P>Select the current segment for data generation routines.
Code for a routine is always output into the segment returned by
FESegID when it is passed the routine symbol handle.
<DL>
<DT><b><i>Parameter</i></b>
<DD><b><i>Definition</i></b>
<DT>seg
<DD>Selects the current segment.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>Returns
<DD>The previous current segment.
</DL>
<P>NOTE: When emitting data into an EXEC or BACK segment, be aware that
the code generator is at liberty to emit code and/or back end data into
that segment anytime you make a call to a code generation routine
(CG*).
Do NOT expect data items to be contiguous in the segment if you have
made an intervening CG* call.
<H2>void BEFlushSeg( segment_id seg )</H2>
<! BEFlushSeg
<! segments
<P>BEFlushSeg informs the back end that no more code/data will be
generated in the specified segment.
For code segments, it must be called after the CGReturn() for the final
function which is placed in the segment.
This causes the code generator to flush all pending information
associated with the segment and allows the front end to free all the
back handles for symbols which were referenced by the code going into
the segment.
(The FORTRAN compiler uses this since each function has its own symbol
table which is thrown out at the end of the function).
<DL>
<DT><b><i>Parameter</i></b>
<DD><b><i>Definition</i></b>
<DT>seg
<DD>The code segment id.
</DL>
<H1>Labels</H1>
<! label, code
<P>The back end uses a <B>label_handle</B> for flow of control.
Each <B>label_handle</B> is a unique code label.
These labels may only be used for flow of control.
In order to define a label in a data segment, a <B>back_handle</B>
must be used.
<H2>label_handle BENewLabel()</H2>
<! BENewLabel
<! label, code
<P>Allocate a new control flow label.
<DL>
<DT>Returns
<DD>A new label_handle.
</DL>
<H2>void BEFiniLabel( label_handle lbl )</H2>
<! BEFiniLabel
<! label, code
<P>Indicate that a label_handle will not be used by the front end
anymore.
This allows the back end to free some memory at some later stage.
<DL>
<DT><b><i>Parameter</i></b>
<DD><b><i>Definition</i></b>
<DT>lbl
<DD>A label_handle
</DL>
<H1>Back Handles</H1>
<! back handle
<! label, data
<P>A <B>back_handle</B> is the front end's handle for a code
generator symbol table entry.
A <B>cg_sym_handle</B> is the code generator's handle for a front
end symbol table entry.
The back end may call FEBack, passing in any cg_sym_handle that has
been passed to it.
The front end must allocate a back_handle via BENewBack if one does not
exist.
Subsequent calls to FEBack should return the same back_handle.
This mechanism is used so that the back end does not have to do symbol
table searches.
For example:
<PRE>
back_handle FEBack( SYMPOINTER sym )
{
    if( sym->back == NULL ) {
	sym->back = BENewBack( sym );
    }
    return( sym->back );
}
</PRE>
<P>It is the responsibility of the front end to free each back_handle,
via BEFreeBack, when it frees the corresponding cg_sym_handle entry.
<P>A back_handle for a symbol having automatic or register storage
duration (auto back_handle) may not be freed until CGReturn is called.
A back_handle for a symbol having static storage duration, (static
back_handle) may not be freed until BEStop is called or until after a
BEFlushSeg is done for a segment and the back_handle will never be
referenced by any other function.
<P>The code generator will not require a back handle for symbols which
are not defined in the current compilation unit.
<P>The front end must define the location of all symbols with static
storage duration by passing the appropriate back_handle to DGLabel.
It must also reserve the correct amount of space for that variable
using DGBytes or DGUBytes.
<P>The front end may also allocate an back_handle with static storage
duration that has no cg_sym_handle associated with it (anonymous
back_handle) by calling BENewBack(NULL).
These are useful for literal strings.
These must also be freed after calling BEStop.
<H2>back_handle BENewBack( cg_sym_handle sym )</H2>
<! BENewBack
<! back handle
<P>Allocate a new back_handle.
<DL>
<DT><b><i>Parameter</i></b>
<DD><b><i>Definition</i></b>
<DT>sym
<DD>The front end symbol handle to be associated with the back_handle.
It may be NULL.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>Returns
<DD>A new back_handle.
</DL>
<H2>void BEFiniBack( back_handle bck )</H2>
<! BEFiniBack
<! back handle
<P>Indicate that <B>bck</B> will never be passed to the back end
again, except to BEFreeBack.
This allows the code generator to free some memory at some later stage.
<DL>
<DT><b><i>Parameter</i></b>
<DD><b><i>Definition</i></b>
<DT>bck
<DD>A back_handle.
</DL>
<H2>void BEFreeBack( back_handle bck )</H2>

<DD><b><i>Definition</i></b>
<DT>bck
<DD>A back_handle.
</DL>
<H1>Type definitions</H1>
<! typing
<P>Base types are defined as constants.
All other types (structures, arrays, unions, etc) are simply defined by
their length.

</DL>
<H1>Procedure Declarations</H1>
<H2>void CGProcDecl( cg_sym_handle name, cg_type type )</H2>
<! CGProcDecl
<! procedures
<! routines
<! functions
<P>Declare a new procedure.
This must be the first routine to be called when generating each
procedure.

Parameters are defined in left to right order, as defined by the
procedure prototype.
<DL>

<DD><b><i>Definition</i></b>
<DT>name
<DD>The symbol table entry for the parameter.
<DT>type
<DD>The type of the parameter.
</DL>
<H2>label_handle CGLastParm()</H2>

Prior to this function, the only calls the front-end is allowed to make
are CGParmDecl and CGAutoDecl.
<H2>void CGAutoDecl( cg_sym_handle name, cg_type type )</H2>
<! CGAutoDecl
<P>Declare an automatic variable.
<P>This routine may be called at any point in the generation of a
function between the calls to CGProcDecl and CGReturn, but must be

<DL>
<DT><b><i>Parameter</i></b>
<DD><b><i>Definition</i></b>
<DT>name
<DD>The symbol table entry for the variable.
<DT>type

</DL>
<H2>temp_handle CGTemp( cg_type type )</H2>
<! CGTemp
<! Variables
<! Temporaries
<P>Yields a temporary with procedure scope.
This can be used for things such as iteration counts for FORTRAN do
loops, or a variable in which to store the return value of a function.
This routine should be used <B>only if necessary</B>.
It should be used when the front end requires a temporary which
persists across a flow of control boundary.
Other temporary results are handled by the expression trees.
<DL>
<DT><b><i>Parameter</i></b>
<DD><b><i>Definition</i></b>
<DT>type
<DD>The type of the new temporary.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>Returns
<DD>A temp_handle which may be passed to CGTempName.
This will be freed and invalidated by the back end when CGReturn is
called.
</DL>
<H1>Expressions</H1>
<! expressions
<P>Expression processing involves building an expression tree in the
back end, using calls to CG routines.
There are routines to generate leaf nodes, binary and unary nodes, and
others.
These routines return a handle for a node in a back end tree structure,
called a <B>cg_name</B>.
This handle must be exactly once in a subsequent call to a CG routine.
A tree may be built in any order, but a cg_name is invalidated by a
call to any CG routine with return type void.
The exception to this rule is CGTrash.
<P>There is no equivalent of the C address of operator.
All leaf nodes generated for symbols, via CGFEName, CGBackName and
CGTempName, yield the address of that symbol, and it is the
responsibility of the front end to use an indirection operator to get
its value.
The following operators are available:

C.
It prevents the back end from performing certain mathematically
correct, but floating point incorrect optimizations.
E.g.

fold the expression into "a*1.2".

<P>The binary O_CONVERT operator is only available on the x86 code
generator.
It is used for based pointer operations (the result type of the
CGBinary call must be a far pointer type).
It effectively performs a MK_FP operation with the left hand side
providing the offset portion of the address, and the right hand side
providing the segment value.
If the right hand side expression is the address of a symbol, or the
type of the expression is a far pointer, then the segment value for the
symbol, or the segment value of the expression is used as the segment
value after the O_CONVERT operation.

<! typing
<! conversions
<P>The type passed into a CG routine is used by the back end as the
type for the resulting node.
If the node is an operator node (CGBinary, CGUnary) the back end will
convert the operands to the result type before performing the
operation.
If the type T_DEFAULT is passed, the code generator will use default
conversion rules to determine the resulting type of the node.
These rules are the same as the ANSI C value preserving rules, with the
exception that characters are not promoted to integers before doing
arithmetic operations.
<P>For example, if a node of type T_UINT_2 and a node of type T_INT_4
are to be added, the back end will automatically convert the operands
to T_INT_4 before performing the addition.
The resulting node will have type T_INT_4.

<DT><b><i>Parameters</i></b>
<DD><b><i>Return Value</i></b>
<DT>( cg_sym_handle, AUX_LOOKUP )
<DD>aux_handle - given a cg_sym_handle, return an aux_handle.
<DT>( aux_handle, CALL_BYTES )
<DD>byte_seq * - A pointer to bytes to be generated instead of a call,
or NULL if a call is to be generated.
<PRE>
typedef struct byte_seq {
    char    length;
    char    data[ 1 ];
} byte_seq;
</PRE>
<! calling conventions
<DT>( aux_handle, CALL_CLASS )
<DD>call_class * - returns call_class of the given aux_handle.
See definitions below.
<DT>( short, FREE_SEGMENT )
<DD>short - A free segment value which is free memory for the code
generator to use.
The first word at segment:0 is the size of the free memory in bytes.
(DOS real mode host only)
<DT>( NULL, OBJECT_FILE_NAME )
<DD>char * - The name of the object file to be generated.
<! calling conventions
<DT>( aux_handle, PARM_REGS )
<DD>hw_reg_set[] - The set of register to be used as parameters.
<DT>( aux_handle, RETURN_REG )
<DD>hw_reg_set * - The return register.
This is only called if the routine is declared to have the
SPECIAL_RETURN call_class.
<DT>( NULL, REVISION_NUMBER )
<DD>int - Front end revision number.
Must return II_REVISION.
<DT>( aux_handle, SAVE_REGS )
<DD>hw_reg_set * - Registers which are preserved by the routine.
<DT>( cg_sym_handle, SHADOW_SYMBOL )
<DD>cg_sym_handle - An alternate handle for a symbol.
Required for FORTRAN.
Usually implemented by turning on the LSB of a pointer or MSB of an
integer.
<DT>( NULL, SOURCE_NAME )
<DD>char * - The name of the source file to be put into the object file.
<DT>( cg_sym_handle, TEMP_LOC_NAME )
<DD> Return one of TEMP_LOC_NO, TEMP_LOC_YES, TEMP_LOC_QUIT.
After the back end has assigned stack locations to those temporaries
which were not placed in registers, it begins to call FEAuxInfo with
this request and passes in the cg_sym_handle for each of those
temporaries.
If the front end responds with TEMP_LOC_QUIT the back end will stop
making TEMP_LOC_NAME requests.
If the front end responds with TEMP_LOC_YES the back end will then
perform a TEMP_LOC_TELL request (see next).
If the front end returns TEMP_LOC_NO the back end moves onto the next
cg_sym_handle in its list.
<DT>( int, TEMP_LOC_TELL )
<DD> Returns nothing.
The 'int' value passed in is the relative position on the stack for the
temporary identified by the cg_sym_handle passed in from the previous
TEMP_LOC_NAME.
The value for an individual temporary has no meaning, but the
difference between two of the values is the number of bytes between the
addresses of the temporaries on the stack.
<DT>( void *, NEXT_DEPENDENCY )
<DD>Returns the handle of the next dependency file for which
information is available.
To start the list off, the back end passes in NULL for the dependency
file handle.
<DT>( void *, DEPENDENCY_TIMESTAMP )
<DD>Given the dependency file handle from the last NEXT_DEPENDENCY
request, return pointer to an unsigned long containing a timestamp
value for the dependency file.
<DT>( void *, DEPENDENCY_NAME )
<DD>Given the dependency file handle from the last NEXT_DEPENDENCY
request, return a pointer to a string containing the name for the
dependency file.
<DT>( NULL, SOURCE_LANGUAGE )
<DD>Returns a pointer to a string which identifies the source language
of the pointer.
E.g.
"C" for C, "FORTRAN" for FORTRAN, "CPP" for C++.
<DT>( cg_sym_handle, DEFAULT_IMPORT_RESOLVE )
<DD>Only called for imported symbols.
Returns a cg_sym_handle for another imported symbol which the reference
should be resolved to if certain conditions are met (see IMPORT_TYPE
request).
If NULL or the original cg_sym_handle is returned, there is no default
import resolution symbol.
<DT>( int, UNROLL_COUNT )
<DD>Returns a user-specified unroll count, or 0 if the user did not
specify an unroll count.
The parameter is the nesting level of the loop for which the request is
being made.
Loops which are not contained inside of other loops are nesting level
1.
If this function returns a non-zero value, the loop in question will be
unrolled that many times (there will be (count + 1) copies of the body).
</DL>
<DL>
<DT><b><i>x86 Parameters</i></b>
<DD><b><i>Return value</i></b>
<DT>( NULL, CODE_GROUP )
<DD>char * - The name of the code group.
<DT>( cg_sym_handle, OBJECT_NAME )
<DD>char * - The object file name of a symbol.
'*' is replaced by FEName( cg_sym_handle ).
'^' is replaced by its upper case equivalent.
'!' is replaced by its lower case equivalent.
If an '\' is present, the character following is used literally.
<DT>( aux_handle, STRETURN_REG )
<DD>hw_reg_set * - The register which points to a structure return
value.
Only called if the routine has the SPECIAL_STRUCT_RETURN attribute.
<DT>( void *, NEXT_IMPORT )
<DD>void * (See notes at end) - A handle for the next symbol to
generate a reference to in the object file.
<DT>( void*, IMPORT_NAME )
<DD>char * - The EXTDEF name to generate given a handle
<DT>( void*, NEXT_LIBRARY )
<DD>void * (See notes at end) - Handle for the next library required
<DT>( void*, LIBRARY_NAME )
<DD>char * - The library name to generate given a handle
<DT>( NULL, DATA_GROUP )
<DD>char * - Used to name DGROUP exactly.
NULL means use no group at all.
<DT>( segment_id, CLASS_NAME )
<DD>NULL - Used to name the class of a segment.
<DT>( NULL, USED_8087 )
<DD>NULL - Indicate that 8087 instructions were generated.
<DT>( NULL, STACK_SIZE_8087 )
<DD>int - How many 8087 registers are reserved for stack.
<DT>( NULL, CODE_LABEL_ALIGNMENT )
<DD>char * - An array x, such that x[i] is the label alignment
requirements for labels nested within i loops.
<DT>( NULL, PROEPI_DATA_SIZE )
<DD>int - How much stack is reserved for the prolog hook routine.
<DT>( cg_sym_handle, IMPORT_TYPE )
<DD>Returns IMPORT_IS_WEAK, IMPORT_IS_LAZY, IMPORT_IS_CONDITIONAL.
If the DEFAULT_IMPORT_RESOLVE request returned a default resolution
symbol the back end then performs an IMPORT_TYPE request to determine
the type of the resolution.
IMPORT_IS_WEAK generates a weak import (the symbol is not searched for
in libraries).
IMPORT_IS_LAZY generates a lazy import (the symbol is searched for in
libraries).
IMPORT_IS_CONDITIONAL is used for eliminating unused virtual functions.
The default symbol resolution is used if none of the conditional
symbols are referenced/defined by the program.
The back end is informed of the list of conditional symbols by the
following three aux requests.
IMPORT_IS_CONDITIONAL_PURE is used for eliminating unused pure virtual
functions.
<DT>( cg_sym_handle, CONDITIONAL_IMPORT )
<DD> Returns void *.
Once the back end determines that it has a conditional import, it
performs this request to get a conditional list handle which is the
head of the list of conditional symbols.
<DT>( void *, CONDITIONAL_SYMBOL )
<DD>Returns a cg_sym_handle.
Give an conditional list handle, return the front end symbol associated
with it.
<DT>( void *, NEXT_CONDITIONAL )
<DD>Given an conditional list handle, return the next conditional list
handle.
Return NULL at the end of the list.
<DT>( aux_handle, VIRT_FUNC_REFERENCE )
<DD>Returns void *.
When performing an indirect function call, the back end invokes
FEAuxInfo passing the aux_handle supplied with the CGInitCall.
If the indirect call is referencing a C++ virtual function, the front
end should return a magic cookie which is the head of a list of virtual
functions that might be invoked by this call.
If it is not a virtual function invocation, return NULL.
<DT>( void *, VIRT_FUNC_NEXT_REFERENCE )
<DD>Returns void *.
Given the magic cookie returned by the VIRT_FUNC_REFERENCE or a
previous VIRT_FUNC_NEXT_REFRENCE, return the next magic cookie in the
list of virtual functions that might be refrenced from this indirect
call.
Return NULL if at the end of the list.
<DT>( void *, VIRT_FUNC_SYM )
<DD>Returns cg_sym_handle.
Given a magic cookie from a VIRT_FUNC_REFERENCE or
VIRT_FUNC_NEXT_REFERENCE, return the cg_sym_handle for that entry in
the list of virtual functions that might be invoked.
<DT>( segment_id, PEGGED_REGISTER )
<DD>Returns a pointer at a hw_reg_set or NULL.
If the pointer is non-NULL and the hw_reg_set is not EMPTY, the
hw_reg_set will indicate a segment register that is pegged (pointing)
to the given segment_id.
The code generator will use this segment register in any references to
objects in the segment.
If the pointer is NULL or the hw_reg_set is EMPTY, the code generator
uses the cg_switches to determine if a segment register is pointing at
the segment or if it will have to load one.
