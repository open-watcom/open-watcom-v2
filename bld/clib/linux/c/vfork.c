/* Since both parent and child will be sharing the same stack, we must
 * take precautions to avoid changing the existing stack frame after
 * the system call returns.  In particular, this means that we cannot do
 * a 'ret' since that pops an address off the stack that the parent would
 * itself later need when it runs. This is not necessary in case of error
 * (because there is no child).
 *
 * Otherwise, the code is equivalent to:
 *
 *  syscall_res res = sys_call0( SYS_vfork );
 *  __syscall_return( pid_t, res );
 *
 * Since no stack is available to save registers before they are used,
 * the caller must not assume their contents will be preserved. This is
 * signalled to the caller with the line:
 *    #pragma aux vfork modify [edx];
 * in the header file.
