C Library Work:
===============

Mandate: organize, cleanup, validate
====================================

Distilled Wisdom:
=================
 -  multiple extensions (c,2c,nc,...) are troublesome for make and clarity
 -  multiple source directories (c,c386,a,a386) are confusing
 -  try to put all source for a given function in one place
 -  excessive conditional compilation obscures things
 -  current directory structure is inconsistent
 -  current directory structure is too coarsely grained
 -  current make system is overly complicated
 -  want to be able to invoke one make command to build a top level library

Major To Do Items:
==================
 -  restructure directories
 -  simplify and clean up makefile system
 -  reduce storage used by library hieararchy, (time stamp files)
 -  move to using wasm in place of masm/optasm/386asm etc (phase out asm code)
 -  map out the sequence of events that occur in the runtime support system
    during program execution startup and shut down

Specific Proposed Changes:
==========================
1.  Move the math library out of the clib hierarchy.
    Make a new project for the math library.
    The math library has different requirements than the clib and should
    be separate.  This will help to simplify the structure of the clib.

2.  The new clib hierarchy will consist of two tiers.  The upper tier
    will contain no source code.  It will consist of a target hierarchy
    containing merged libraries and second tier directories containing
    component libraries.
    The target hierarchy will be rooted in clib\library and will contain
    a target directory structure.

3.  The new clib hierarchy will live within the following rules:
    a. all C source files go into a 'c' directory, .c extension
    b. all ASM source files go into a 'a' directory, .asm extension
    c. all header files go into a 'h' directory, .h extension
    d. all object files go into a target directory, .obj extension

4.  In place of the former extension/directory differentiation, file names
    will have suffixes as follows:
	generic		- name
	Intel 16 bit	- name086
	Intel 32 bit	- name386
	os2		- nameos2
	os2 1.x		- nameo16
	os2 2.x		- nameo32
	NT		- namewnt
	Win386		- namew32
	QNX		- nameqnx
	QNX 16		- nameq16
	QNX 32		- nameq32
	NetWare		- namenov
    This may lead to some slightly cramped names.
    The goal is to support having all source for a given function in one
    directory.  The intention is that the finely grained directory structure
    should allow easy selection of the right directory, and then wgrep can be
    used to locate all the files that contain the function.

5.  Existing groupings of files into library components (ANSI,DOS,_DOS,HEAP)
    will be subdivided as follows:
	char		- character manipulation functions
	memory		- memory manipulation functions
	string		- string manipulation functions
	mbyte		- multibyte manipulation functions
	convert		- conversion manipulation functions
	heap		- heap manipulation functions
	search		- searching and sorting functions
	time		- time functions
	streamio	- stream i/o functions
	process		- process primitive functions
	environ		- process environment functions
	direct		- directory management functions
	handleio	- handle level i/o functions
	file		- file manipulation functions
	conio		- console i/o functions
	bios		- BIOS functions
	_dos		- MS-DOS functions
	intel		- 80x86 functions
	misc		- miscellaneous functions
	startup		- run time startup functions
	cgsupp		- compiler support routines
	kanji		- kanji support routines
	mthread		- multi-threading support functions
	defwin		- default windowing system
	qnx		- qnx specific functions
	...		- there are, no doubt, more
    This is based on the Overview section of the C Library Reference.
    Files that are specific to one platform, and have no analog on any
    other platform will be located the platform specific area.
    (i.e. qnx,...)

6.  The following first tier target libraries will be built:
	Dos16		- tiny,ms,mm,mc,ml,mh,overlay mm,overlay ml
	Dos32		- register ms,stack ms
	OS/2 1.x	- ms,mm,mc,ml,mh,multi-thread ml,DLL ml
	OS/2 2.x	- multi-thread DLL register ms,
			  multi-thread DLL stack ms
	QNX 16		- ms,mm,mc,ml,mh,share
	QNX 32		- register ms
	Win 3.1		- ms,mm,mc,ml
	Win386		- multi-thread DLL register mf,
			  multi-thread DLL stack mf
	Win NT		- multi-thread DLL register ms,
			  multi-thread DLL stack ms
	NetWare		- mulit-thread stack ms
	Penpoint	- stack mf, multi-thread stack mf,
			  debugging stack mf
	Penpoint hobbit - register (tentative)
	Kanji 16	- ms,mm,mc,ml,mh
	Kanji 32	- register ms, stack ms
	nec 32		- register ms, stack ms
    Some of these target systems are really /mf but we are building /ms.
    This is to avoid problems with calling into the /ms math library.
    It means that all calls out to user code (including startup) must
    be bracketed with a setup of the segment registers for FLAT and an
    assumption that the user code trashes the segment registers on return.
    This is required for the /r switch that is used to build the library.
    The remaining /mf libraries (Win386??,Penpoint) either don't have
    the math issue or have other issues.

7.  The following naming convention will be used for the first and
    second tier target hierarchies:

       <system>.<processor>\<model>_
			    [<convention>]		- optional
			    [<overlays>]		- optional
			    [<threading>]		- optional
			    [<dll>]			- optional
			    [<share>]			- optional
			    [<debug>]			- optional

   where:
    <system> is one of:
	msdos|qnx|os2|windows|winnt|netware|penpoint|kanji|necdos
    <processor> is one of
	086|286|386|hob|alf|mip|rs6|...
    <model> is one of:
	tiny		- mt
	small		- ms
	medium		- mm
	compact		- mc
	large		- ml
	huge		- mh
	flat		- mf
    <convention> is only used on 32 bit targets and is one of:
	register	- r
	stack		- s
    <overlays> is only used to designate 16 bit overlaid libs and
	is indicated by - ov
    <threading> is only used to designate 16 bit multi-thread libs and
	is indicated by - mt
    <dll> is only used to designate 16 bit DLL libs and is indicated
	by		- dll
    <share> is only used to designate shareable libs and is indicated
	by		- sh
    <debug> is only used to designate debugging libs and is indicated
	by		- db

    This scheme, coupled with the intended targets, produces the following
    first tier target hierarchy:
	msdos.086\
	    mt ms mm mc ml mh mm_ov ml_ov
	msdos.286\
	    ms mm mc ml mh ml_mt ml_dll
	msdos.386\
	    ms_r ms_s
	os2.286\
	    ms mm mc ml mh ml_mt ml_dll
	os2.386\
	    ms_r ms_s
	qnx.286\
	    ms mm mc ml mh ml_sh
	qnx.386\
	    ms_r
	windows.086\
	    ms mm mc ml
	windows.386\
	    mf_r mf_s
	winnt.386\
	    ms_r ms_s
	netware.386\
	    ms_s
	penpoint.386\
	    mf_s mf_smt mf_sdb
	penpoint.hob\
	    ???
	kanji.086\
	    ms mm mc ml mh
	kanji.386\
	    ms_r ms_s
	necdos.386\
	    ms_r ms_s

8.  The making of the libraries is still under study.  It has been
    suggested that VIPER (vmake.exe) could be used to maintain the structure
    of the clib and to build its components.  Alternatively, a modification
    of the existing makefile system could be used.
    The following two points describe how the clib could be maintained
    under each system.

9.  The makefile systems will be organized around a tree structure.

    a.	There are three basic make operations:
	  i) transform source into object (assemble,compile)
	     (no pre-process, as wasm.exe obviates this step)
	 ii) combine object into component library
	iii) combine component libraries into complete libraries
	The first 2 operations occur at the second tier of the directory
	structure, the last operation occurs at the top tier of the directory
	structure.

    b.	Each component library will have a two .mif files in the second
	tier.
	One will be optional and list any important dependancies.
	The other will list all the objects required for each of the
	required targets. It will be implemented with make macros
	(potentially nested) to ensure the following:
          i) no object file will be listed more than once
	 ii) the addition of an object file will require exactly one change

    c.	Each component target directory will have a makefile that sets several
	options and then includes the .mif file which lists the source/object
	files and then includes one or more .mif files out of the root to
	drive the build.  No model.inc file will be required, thanks to
	the capabilities of wasm.exe.
	Finally, if there are dependancies, the dependancy file will be
	included.

    d.	Each complete target directory will have a makefile that lists the
	required component libraries and then includes a .mif file out of the
	root to drive the merging of the component libraries.

    e.	All other .mif files will reside in the root of the library.
	These .mif files will be organized around the concepts of building
	libraries and merging libraries.
	The building .mif files will attempt to factor out as much
	redundancy as possible, without obscuring the intent of the build.
	The intention is to allow modifications to the library build to be
	effected with a change to one .mif file.
	The merging .mif files will be driven by the list of component
	libraries required for the complete library.

    f.	The top level .mif files will also support the specification of
	extra_cflags, extra_aflags, extra_cppflags, extra_lflags, in the
	target makefiles to allow for special cases.

    g.  Support for controlled makes will be driven by keywords in the
	makefiles. Each makefile will contain several comments at the
	begining that can be used to list the targets that will require
	this library. The categories are as follows:
	    all						- all targets
	    tiny,small,compact,medium,large,huge,flat,
	    nomodel					- memory model
	    16bit,32bit					- code target
	    stack,register				- calling convention
	    inline,calls				- floating point
	    heap,_dos,nec,string,streamio,handleio,
	    filesys,startup,process,cgsupp, kanji,mbyte,
	    mthread,defwin,qnx				- component of library
	    overlay					- overlay libraries
	    threading					- multi-thread library
	    dll						- dll support
	    share				        - sharable library
	    debug					- debugging library
	    dos,os2,qnx,windows,win386,nt,netware,
	    penpoint,kanji,nec				- target system

	As an example, the o1lmt target directory will contain the following
	    #pmake:all
	    #pmake:large
	    #pmake:threading
	    #pmake:16bit
	    #pmake:os2
	A pmake.exe (modified from sweep.exe for depth-first traversal and
	text pattern matching) will visit each target directory and run
	wmake.exe if the makefile contains all the specified targets.
    
	i.e.
	    pmake.exe large threading os2 16bit
		Would sweep the clib and execute the makefile for os2 1.x
		large multi-thread libraries.
	    pmake.exe all 
		Would sweep the clib and execute the makefile for all targets
		since all makefiles will contain #target=all
	    pmake.exe small dos 16bit
		Would sweep the clib and execute the makefile for all small
		dos 16 bit libraries.  This would effectively build the
		``\lang\lib286\dos\clibs.lib'' file.
    

10. Viper (vmake.exe) is driven by configuration (viper.cfg), project (.prj)
    target (.tgt), and zombie target (.tgt) files.

    a.  A target (.tgt) file will be created for each .lib file to be
        built.
	  - viper allows nesting of zombie target (.tgt) files
	  - base zombie files will be defined that simply list object files
	  - nested zombie files will be build up that contain other zombie
	      files to generate a complete list of objects needed for a
	      specific component library
	  - a target (.tgt) file will be defined for each .lib file to be
	      created, it will contain a zombie that lists all the object
	      files required

    b.	A project (.vpr) file for each clib subcomponent (heap,cgsupp...)
	will be defined.
	  - when viper is invoked, it takes a project (.vpr) file
	  - the project (.vpr) file will point to the target (.tgt) files
	      which define each .lib that is created as part of this
	      subcomponent
	  - thus the clib will consist of approx 20 projects, each containing
	      approx 50 target libraries

    c.	The configuration file (viper.cfg) defines all rules used to convert
	input files to output files.
	  - when a .tgt file is created it specifies what form of target
	      will be created
	  - this form can be used to select options out of the conversion
	      rules
	  - by defining a large number of target forms, one for each target
	      library (approx 50), the selection of switches can be driven
	      automatically

    d.	Bviper.exe is a batch mode viper that supports generation of a
	makefile to do the work defined by a set of targets. Build machine
	construction of the library would consist of invocations of
	bviper.exe followed by wmake.exe in each project (.vpr) directory.

11. The following targets will be validated:
	Dos16
	Dos16 Pharlap286
	Dos16 16M
	Dos32 Pharlap386
	Dos32 Dos4g
	Dos32 Ergo
	Dos32 CodeBuilder
	Dos32 FlashTek
	OS/2 1.x
	OS/2 2.x
	OS/2 2.x default windowing
	QNX 16
	QNX 32
	Windows 3.1
	Windows 3.1 default windowing
	Win386
	Win386 default windowing
	Windows NT
	Windows NT default windowing
	Penpoint
	NetWare 3.11
	NetWare 4.0
	nec - what needs to be tested here?

    Validation will consist of the set of examples found in the C Lib Reference.
    Expansion of the validation test suite should also be performed.

12. The validation process will be automated as much as possible.
    The test environment can be encapsulated into one machine.  The major
    requirement is 2 physical hard disks to allow 8 partition table entries.
    The system needs to be able to boot:
	DOS,NT,QNX,OS/2 2.x,NetWare 3.11,NetWare 4.0
    The systems needs to have installed:
	Windows,WIN-OS2,Penpoint environment,various DOS extenders
