    // check to make sure our low point adjustments are sane.
    // at the time of this patch, Open Watcom defaults to 64KB stack size for Win32s.
    // Windows 3.1 actually honors the stack reservation size and gives us 64KB of stack.
    // if you do the math above for the Win32s case, you'll realize our low point adjustment
    // pushes the low point 72KB from the base which is 8KB past the top of the stack!
    // the true fix to the problem would be to set the default stack size for Win32s to
    // something larger (128KB), and to take the Windows 95 default of 1MB if targeting
    // Windows 95 or NT. But, if we were told to use a smaller stack, then we need to
    // deal with it. If the user compiled their EXE with a smaller stack then stack overflow
    // issues are their problem, not ours.
