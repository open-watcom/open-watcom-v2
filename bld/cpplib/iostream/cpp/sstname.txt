******************************* STRSTREAMBUF *********************************

Filename: ssfempsz.cpp
Declaration:
    std::strstreambuf::strstreambuf( int size )
Semantics: Create an empty strstreambuf that will use dynamic allocation
           of the specified size.


Filename: ssfempsf.cpp
Declaration:
    std::strstreambuf::strstreambuf( void *(*alloc)( long ), void (*free)( void * ) )
Semantics: Create an empty strstreambuf that will use dynamic allocation
           using the specified allocate/free functions.


Filename: ssfstbuf.cpp
Declaration:
    void std::strstreambuf::__strstreambuf( char *ptr, int size, char *pstart )
Semantics: Initialize a streambuf.


Filename: ssfdestr.cpp
Declaration:
    std::strstreambuf::~strstreambuf()
Semantics: Destroy a strstreambuf.


Filename: ssfstr.cpp
Declaration:
    char *std::strstreambuf::str()
Semantics: Freeze the strstreambuf, and return a pointer to the contents.


Filename: ssfoverf.cpp
Declaration:
    int std::strstreambuf::overflow( int c )
Semantics: The streambuf level has decided that its buffer is too small for the
           characters that the user is trying to put.


Filename: ssfundrf.cpp
Declaration:
    int std::strstreambuf::underflow()
Semantics: The streambuf has decided that it needs more characters for input.


Filename: ssfsetbf.cpp
Declaration:
    streambuf *std::strstreambuf::setbuf( char *, int size )
Semantics: Just remember the size to allocate next time.


Filename: ssfgpos.cpp
Declaration:
    streampos get_position( streamoff offset, ios::seekdir direction,
        char *base, char *ptr, char *end, char *extended_end )
Semantics: For "put" buffers, "extended_end" equals "end".
           For "get" buffers, "extended_end" may be greater than "end" if there
           are characters in the put area, allowing the seek to go beyond the
           end of the get area.
           The get area must then be extended.


Filename: ssfseeko.cpp
Declaration:
    streampos std::strstreambuf::seekoff( streamoff offset, ios::seekdir direction,
        int mode )
Semantics: Position either the get and/or put pointer to the specified position.


Filename: ssfdoall.cpp
Declaration:
    int std::strstreambuf::doallocate()
Semantics: Do the allocation required if allocate() thinks it's needed.


Filename: ssfsync.cpp
Declaration:
    int std::strstreambuf::sync()
Semantics: A strstreambuf can never be out of sync,
           so return "something other than EOF".

Semantics: Construct a default strstreambase.


Filename: ssbconsz.cpp

             : __strstrmbuf( str, size, pstart ) 


Filename: ssbdestr.cpp
Declaration:
    std::strstreambase::~strstreambase()
Semantics: Destroy ststreambase.

           string pointed at by str.

              : strstreambase( (char *)str, 0, NULL )

           string pointed at by str.

Declaration:
    std::istrstream::istrstream( char *str, int size )
              : strstreambase( str, size, NULL )
Semantics: Construct an istrstream that reads from the characters starting at
           str for length size.

Declaration:
    std::istrstream::istrstream( signed char *str, int size )
              : strstreambase( (char *)str, size, NULL )
Semantics: Construct an istrstream that reads from the characters starting at
           str for length size.


Filename: isscoucz.cpp
Declaration:
    std::istrstream::istrstream( unsigned char *str, int size )
              : strstreambase( (char *)str, size, NULL )
Semantics: Construct an istrstream that reads from the characters starting at
	   str for length size.


Filename: issdestr.cpp
Declaration:
    std::istrstream::~istrstream()
Semantics: Destroy istrstream object.



******************************* OSTRSTREAM ***********************************

Filename: ossdestr.cpp
Declaration:
    std::ostrstream::~ostrstream()
Semantics: Destroy the ostrstream object, which means destroying the
           strstreambuf buffer.
