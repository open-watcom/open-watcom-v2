notes:
        - there are multiple CODE_LOAD records
        - after all the ADDR_MAPS have been processed (after a CODE_LOAD),
          use DoAddrMap to invoke debugger's symbolic code
        - REMAP_SECTION records will occur after an OVL_LOAD. The data
          in them should be fed into the RemapSection routine
        - CALLGRAPH records must immediately follow the corresponding
          SAMPLES record
