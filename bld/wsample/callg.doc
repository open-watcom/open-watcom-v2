		Call Graph Information in the Sampler
		=====================================

To increase the usefulness of the Watcom Execution Profiler, support
for call graph information in the sample file has been added.  Each
sample is now stored along with the sequence of calling functions.
With this new information, the user is able to examine, for example,
only samples which occurred in routine bar, called by foo and main.
In addition, it is now possible to reassign samples from routines into
the routine from which they were called.  Thus samples which land in
library routines may be reassigned to the calling routine, giving the
user a better feel for where the time is actually spent in the program.

Because speed and storage are sacrificed for this additional information,
it should remain as an option in the sampler.  The Watcom Execution 
Profiler automatically senses whether a sample file contains call graph
information and adjusts itself accordingly.  In the Watcom Samplers, the
/c option specifies that call graph information should be included in the
sample file.

Storing this new information obviously requires modifications to the sampler.
As the program is executing, it is necessary to keep track of the current
sequence of called routines.  This is done through the use of prologue and
epilogue routines called at the beginning and end of every function executed.
The prologue routine requires a certain amount of stack space to store the
address from which the current function was called and a pointer to the 
information stored for the previously called function (we're in effect 
creating a sub-stack of call graph information, which takes the form of a
singly-linked list).  Thus the runtime stack might look like this immediately
after leaving the prologue routine:


	+-------+
	+ CS:IP	+		address from which bar() was called
	+-------+
	+	+--+		pointer to next callgraph stack entry
	+-------+  |
	 .......   |		other stack storage
	 .......   |
	 .......   |
	+-------+  |
	+ CS:IP	+<-+		address from which foo() was called
	+-------+
	+	+--+
	+-------+  |
	 .......   |
	 .......   |
	 .......   |
	+-------+  |
	+ CS:IP	+<-+		address from which main() was called
	+-------+
	+	+--||
	+-------+
	 .......
	 .......
	 
	
In addition to maintaining this information, it is useful to remember
a CS:IP address in the most recently known entered function.  Otherwise,
if a sample occurs in printf() called from bar(), the profiler would
erroneously assume that printf() was called by foo(), since __PRO and
__EPI hooks are not installed in printf().  Static variables are sufficient
for this purpose.  We also need static variables to store the address of
the top entry in the call graph stack.  Finally, since it's convenient not
to re-write the entire stack on each sample, variables pop and push are
used to remember the difference between the last written sample.  These
are initialized to 0, and reset to 0 by the sampler each time a sample
is written.


Pseudo-code for a possible implementation of the prologue and epilogue
routines __PRO and __EPI follows:

__PRO	new_stor->ptr = cgraph_top
	new_stor->addr = caller's cs:ip
	top_addr = cs:ip in current function
	cgraph_top = new_stor
	push_no = push_no + 1

__EPI:	top_addr = cgraph_top->addr
	cgraph_top = cgraph_top->ptr
	if push_no = 0
	    pop_no = pop_no + 1
	else
	    push_no = push_no - 1
	endif
	
Once these routines are in place and functioning properly, changes must be
made to the sampler itself.  For communication purposes, the sampler must
be told where to look for the common variables (consisting of the variables
cgraph_top, top_addr, push_no and pop_no in the p-code above).  This is
done by means of an int 3 from the program before execution begins.
To distinguish this debugger interrupt from that associated with a mark,
[DX:AX] should be NULL while [CX:BX] holds a pointer to this common area.
The interrupt handler can easily test [DX:AX] to determine whether we're
dealing with a mark or this special call at the beginning of the program.

When the sampler is triggered, we must communicate with the executing program
to determine the current state of the call graph information.  This can be
done by first reading the common variables from the storage area pointed
to by the initial int 3; by then working down the stack of call graph
information as far as necessary (only push # need be read); and by finally
resetting push # and pop # to zero (so the difference from this sample is
written at the next sampling).  Note that if the common area is unknown (ie.
the initial int 3 has not yet occurred), setting push_no and pop_no to -1
notifies the profiler of this fact, and these samples will be stored with
no call graph information.

When a timer interrupt occurs, we now must store this call graph information
along with the actual sample.  However, since the samples are not written
to storage immediately, it's conventient to store the samples and call graph
information together, and extract them into their separate records only
as they are written.  This prevents the necessity of maintaining two buffers.

Thus a sample could be stored as:

CS:IP		actual sample
pop:push	pop/push change from previous sample
CS:IP		address in most recently entered function (top_addr)
CS:IP	   \
CS:IP		new call graph addresses to store in sample
...		(of which there are push #)
CS:IP	   /

Remember that in case we exceed our buffer before the samples are written
to storage, we must back up to the start of the previous sample information
(which is no longer simply one entry back in the array).

This information must written to storage separately, however, as specified
by the file sample.h.  It should be easy to extract the components as
necessary.  The format of the sample file follows.  Note particularly the
SAMP_CALLGRAPH record format, which must immediately follow the corresponding
SAMP_SAMPLES record as noted.
