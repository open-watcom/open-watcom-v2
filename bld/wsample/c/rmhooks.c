/*
  The timer interrupt (0x08) is special in that the getvect and setvect
  DOS calls will put an intermediate interrupt function ahead of your
  interrupt function and thus you will always get the same cs:ip value.
  **********************************************************************
  We want to get the cs:ip value that the program was executing at
  so we must bend the rules a bit and modify the interrupt vector table
  directly using INT_LOCATE.
  This treatement is not necessary for int 21h and 28h but is used instead
  of getvec() and setvec() following some law of programming inertia.
