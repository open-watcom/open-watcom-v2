	FILE: sim.doc

	sim.c benchmark 

	It will be best to first create a directory (e.g., 'sim') to 
	hold the sim files.



1.      UNPACKING sim.shar

	Do the following to unpack sim.shar:


	sh sim.shar

	It contains the files:
	sim.c
	sim.doc
	simrun.doc
	tob.38-44
	liv.42-48

	NOTE: sim.tbl (table of sim results) is not included in 
	      sim.shar.


2.      CHANGING COMPILER OPTIONS

	(a) Compiler options
	
	As a minimum you should run with the '-O' option, but be
	aware that most compilers come with numerous options (switches)
	that may (or may not) improve program execution speed.

	(b) Timer options

	The default '-DUNIX' option is one of several timer options
	avaliable.
	
	The timer option MUST be specified for the program to compile.
	
	The various timer options are available at the end of sim.c which
	you may need to examine to find the right match for your machine.
	Here are the current timer choices (the actual option name
	follows the '-D'):

	'-DAmiga'       for Amiga systems.
	'-DUNIX'        for UNIX systems (preferred)
	'-DUNIX_Old'    for UNIX systems (avoid if possible)
	'-DVMS'         for VMS systems 
	'-DBORLAND_C'   for PC's with Borland C
	'-DMSC'         for PC's with Microsoft C
	'-DMAC'         for Macintosh systems with Think C
	'-DIPSC'        for i860 IPSC systems
	'-DFORTRAN_SEC' for Cray systems (preferred)
	'-DGTODay'      for UNIX systems
	'-DCTimer'      for Cray systems (avoid if possible)
	'-DUXPM'        for Fijitsu UXP/M systems.



4.      COMPILING

	If you are using UNIX (or gcc) then as a minimum you can do:

	cc -DUNIX -O sim.c -o sim

	or

	gcc -DUNIX -O sim.c -o sim

	or whatever ...

	There are generally other options that one can use which can
	improve performance beyond that obtained from the '-O' alone.



5.      RUNNING THE PROGRAM

	Do the following to run the program:

	sim 8 tob.38-44 liv.42-48 


6.      REPORTING RESULTS

	Edit the ascii file 'simrun.doc' and please add in the 
	following:
		    
		    NAME: [ e.g., Matt Pounder ]
		    DATE: [ e.g., 14 Aug 1993 ]
	   EMAIL ADDRESS: [ e.g., pounder@wrestle.state.edu ]

    MACHINE/SYSTEM/MODEL: [ e.g., HP 9000/735 ]
		     CPU: [ e.g., PA-RISC 7100 ]
   CPU CLOCK SPEED (MHz): [ e.g., 99.0 MHz ]
	   OS/OS-VERSION: [ e.g., HP-UX 9.00 ]
	COMPILER/VERSION: [ e.g., gcc 3.4.2 ]
	COMPILER OPTIONS: [ e.g., -DUNIX -O2 -finline-functions ]
		
		COMMENTS: [ e.g.,  None.]    
		    
		 RESULTS:
     USER RUN TIME (sec):


	Email simrun.doc to aburto@marlin.nosc.mil and I will include
	in, and maintain, table of results. Results and other programs 
	are available via anonymous ftp to 'ftp.nosc.mil' in
	directory 'pub/aburto'. The IP address is: 128.49.192.51

	Thank you very much ...
