Paul Fast, December 23, 1993
.np
&company. Windows Programming Interface (WPI) is a developers tool to aid in
porting applications from Microsoft Windows to IBM Presentation Manager (PM).
The goal in the creation of WPI (pronounced wippee) is to supply programmers
with a set of macros and library routines which allow them to quickly convert
an application which already exists in Windows code to PM.  It should be
mentioned that this will not necessarily give a very efficient PM program;
only a working executable in short period of time.  Using WPI also allows
the developer the luxury of having only one copy of the source instead of
a Windows version and a PM version.  The WPI interface has evolved only as
functionality is required; future projects may use Windows features which
require additional enhancements to WPI.
.np
WPI is explicitly designed to port Windows functionality to OS2/PM
(not the other way around).  Because of this, converted projects may
require additional system dependent code to take advantage of native
OS/2 features (such as drag and drop or notebooks in OS/2).
.np
This document is intended to be used by developers porting applications
from Windows to PM as an introduction to using WPI.  It notes situations
which are similar to Windows code and some which are quite different from
Windows code.
.*
.section What is WPI?
.*
.np
WPI is a combination of macros and library routines.  The WPI project is
in ./bld/wpi and contains subdirectories for source code, header files, and
libraries.  The header file wpi.h includes the type header file wpitypes.h
and either wpi_win.h or wpi_os2.h depending on the platform for which
you wish to compile.  The header files wpi_os2.h and wpi_win.h contain the
macros and prototypes for functions which correspond to Windows API calls
when compiling under the Windows platform and PM API calls when compiling
for the OS2 platform.  It should be noted that these files are not
necessarily complete.  These files will constantly be modified and further
macros will no doubt be added as their need arises.  Therefore, if a
particular function is required by the developer and it does not already
exist, it is the job of that developer to add it to both wpi_win.h and
wpi_os2.h.  The source code for the library routines are in wpi_win.c and
wpi_os2.c.
.np
To distinguish between the Windows and PM platforms, the &company. C compiler
provides a __OS2_PM__ macro which indicates that the program is being
compiled for OS2 Presentation Manager.  To separate Windows and PM code
something like the following is needed:
.np
:XMP.
#ifdef __OS2_PM__

         // PM code

#else

         // Windows code

#endif
:eXMP.
.np
The file wpitypes.h contains the conversion of types from Windows to PM.
There are some cases in which Windows types have equivalent PM data types,
such as HDC and HWND.  These obviously are not redefined.  In other cases,
a non existent equivalent can easily be added.  For example the data type
ULONG in PM is defined as unsigned long for Windows in wpitypes.h.  It should
be noted that not all data type definitions are as neat and clean as this;
however, an attempt has been made to make this as invisible to the developer
as possible.
.np
The files wpi_win.h and wpi_win.c contain macros and routines which translate
to Windows API calls under the Windows platform and wpi_os2.h and wpi_os2.c
translate to PM API calls under the PM platform.  Some of these routine will
have the same parameter list as the Windows version of the API and others
may appear drastically different than their Windows counterpart.  Many of the
Windows APIs do not have corresponding PM APIs and in these cases, many lines
of code are required to mimick the Windows call.  In cases where more than
one line of code is required to convert the Windows code to PM, the routines
have been coded as library functions instead of macros.  All WPI functions
are prefixed by _wpi_ and contain no uppercase characters.  Furthermore, an
attempt has been made to keep the macro names as similar to the Windows
functions as possible.  Hence, BeginPaint is called _wpi_beginpaint.  In
cases where the Windows API has an exact equivalent in PM, the Windows
function is defined as is for PM. For example, GetClientRect has an PM
equivalent of WinQueryWindowRect and hence GetClientRect has been defined
as WinQueryWindowRect for PM.  This means that some Windows API names can
remain the way they are.  Even if an API has an exact equivalent and is
defined that way for PM, it is also defined in the form _wpi_functionname
for both Windows and PM.  It is up to the developer as to whether they wish
to use the Windows name or the WPI name.
.*
.section Converting Windows Applications
.*
.np
The nature of the application will dictate the amount of code reusability
available through WPI (and hence the usefulness of WPI).  If the application
deals with elements that are similar on both the Windows and PM platform
then perhaps the developer can reuse 90% or more of their code.  In cases
where Windows and PM handle things quite differently, reuseability may only
reach 70-80%.  The developer should determine places in their Windows
application that may differ quite drastically in PM such as file storage
formats or window classes or messages.  These will be the most difficult
modules of code to port.
.np
The method the developer uses to port is really up to him or her.  The most
straightforward way is to (after reading this document) choose a module in
the applications code that is small or has relatively few major Windows/PM
differences and begin there.  The file wpi.h will need to be included (it
includes the other WPI header files) in every module that uses WPI macros.
Every function call that is a Windows API will need to be replaced with the
equivalent _wpi_functionname macro.  The simplest way to determine which
macro to use is to search for the API name in wpi.h.  It should be
relatively easy to determine the name of the macro and whether or not the
parameter list has changed.  The OS2 Toolkit contains on-line help which
describes the PM APIs.  This will also prove to be very useful since some
macros may take parameters that are required and only used in the PM calls.
.np
The user may find it easier to have separate code for the initialization
of their program.  While Windows has a WinMain key word, PM applications
simply begin with the normal C main.  Moreover, PM requires the user to
initialize the windows and create a message queue.  Although
_wpi_createwindow and _wpi_registerclass are provided in WPI, the user may
find the code to register and create windows different enough to warrant
separate Windows and PM code.  It is safest to look at the WPI code to see
if it performs as you wish.
.np
One final word on converting code.  Some applications have unique memory
allocation functions they use in order to track memory.  Since WPI
occassionally allocates memory, users may wish to use their own memory
allocation and freeing routines.  They can do so by defining the symbol
_wpi_malloc and _wpi_free to be their own routines.  If they are not defined,
WPI sets them to the default of malloc and free.  All memory allocations
and frees are performed with _wpi_malloc and _wpi_free (the exception is in
_wpi_selectobject which uses alloca. This routine is discussed later).
.*
.section Differences in Philosophies
.*
.np
Before beginning the PM conversion, you should become aquainted with a few
differences between the philosophies of Windows and PM.  This document does
not cover all of them; only the ones that pertain to WPI.
.*
.section PM Windows
.*
.np
To begin with, windows are put together slightly differently.  A typical
Windows window has a title bar with a system menu and application menu,
border and a client area.  These are all part of the window indicated by one
HWND.  In PM, each of these components has its own HWND and all are
considered to be children of the frame window HWND.  Hence, the client area
has its own HWND as does the menu bar, the scroll bars, etc.  Drawing in the
client area should be done by referencing the HWND of the client; however,
visibility, destruction and menu operations need to reference the HWND of
the frame.  To overcome some of these problems, the macros
_wpi_getclient(hwnd) and _wpi_getframe(hwnd) have been defined which do
nothing in Windows and return the client window handle of the supplied
frame handle and the frame handle of the given client (respectively).
Moreover, through WPI, HMENU has been defined as an HWND and routines have
been created which allow the user to use an HMENU as it is in Window.
.*
.section Instances and Anchor Blocks
.*
.np
Windows programs have the concept of an instance which is required by some
functions to differentiate between possibly numerous instances of the program.
PM does not have an instance identifier, however it does have an anchor block.
In WPI, instance handles and anchor blocks are associated in the data type
WPI_INST. This type should be used instead of the INSTANCE type for declaring
INSTANCE variables in Windows.  For PM, it is defined as a follows:
.np
:XMP.
typedef struct {
        HAB             hab;
        HMODULE mod_handle;
} WPI_INST;
:eXMP.
.np
The hab is the anchor block that is required for many of the function like
creating presentation spaces and registering windows.  The mod_handle field
is required when working with DLLs.  It is particularly required for loading
accelerator tables, menus and other resources.  If you are not working with
DLLs, you may simply set this field to NULL.  PM functions that require HABs
will have macros that accept a WPI_INST and the hab field will be extracted
from the structure.  The following routines handle the WPI_INST data type:
.np
.begnote $setptnt 3
.note _wpi_setwpiinst( hab, mod_handle, &wpi_instance )
.np
Use this function to initialize a WPI_INST.
For Windows set hab to the instance and set mod_handle to NULL.
.note _wpi_issameinst( inst1, inst2 )
.np
This compares the two instances and returns whether or not they are the same.
.note _wpi_setmodhandle( name, inst )
.np
This sets the module handle only, of a WPI_INST.
This function does nothing in Windows.
.note _wpi_setanchorblock( hwnd, inst )
.np
This sets the anchor block only, of a WPI_INST given a window handle.
For Windows, this sets the instance.
.endnote
.*
.section Coordinates and Rectangles
.*
.np
Another major difference between Windows and PM is the coordinate system
used for the desktop.  In Windows the default for the origin is the top left
of the screen with the axes extending positively to the right and down.  In
PM, the origin is the bottom left and the axes extend positively to the right
and up.  Therefore, the coordinates for Windows will differ from that of PM.
In fact, PM has a slightly different definition for their rectangle data
type which also reflects its coordinate origin. Where Windows has:
.np
:XMP.
typedef struct {
        int     left;
        int     top;
        int     right;
        int     bottom;
} RECT;
:eXMP.
.np
PM has
.np
:XMP.
typedef struct {
        LONG    xLeft;
        LONG    yBottom;
        LONG    xRight;
        LONG    yTop;
} RECTL;
:eXMP.
.np
Aside from the different type names the issues that needed resolving through
WPI were the differences in field names and the different types for the
fields.  The different structure field names make accessing individual fields
in the rectangle structure awkward and the different types of the fields once
they are accessed is important to bear in mind.  WPI defines a data type
WPI_RECT which is RECT in Windows and RECTL in PM.  To get and set the values
of the structure, a call must be made to a routine (see below) supplying the
rectangle structure and the values for the fields. A data type called
WPI_RECTDIM has been created which is the type of the fields of the structure.
WPI_RECTDIM is defined as LONG in PM and int in Windows.  The following
routines handle rectangles and assume that left, top, right, and bottom are
defined as WPI_RECTDIM:
.begnote $setptnt 3
.note _wpi_setrectvalues(&r, left, top, right, bottom)
.np
In Windows this simply sets the values of the fields.
In PM this will set top to yBottom and bottom to yTop.
This function can be useful when you have Windows code which subtracts bottom
from top to get window heights.
.note _wpi_setwrectvalues(&r, left, top, right, bottom)
.np
This will set the values of the relative fields in both Windows and PM
(ie no switching is performed between top and bottom).
.note _wpi_getrectvalues(r, &left, &top, &right, &bottom)
.np
This will retrieve the values of the rectangle structure in Windows as
expected and will assign the value of yBottom to top and yTop to bottom.
Again, this is because of the difference in the coordinate systems.
.note _wpi_getwrectvalues(r, &left, &top, &right, &bottom)
.np
This will retrieve the values of the fields in both Windows and PM as
expected (ie no switching is performed between top and bottom).
.endnote
Because some developers may wish to work strictly with the int data type,
the following equivalent functions have been created which do the same as
the above routines, but accept as parameters int instead of WPI_RECTDIM:
.begnote $setptnt 3
.note _wpi_setintrectvalues(&r, left, top, right, bottom)
.note _wpi_setintwrectvalues(&r, left, top, right, bottom)
.note _wpi_getintrectvalues(r, &left, &top, &right, &bottom)
.note _wpi_getintwrectvalues(r, &left, &top, &right, &bottom)
.endnote
Using these macros will at first be annoying; however the need to have a
WPI_RECT lies in the fact that many macros will require a Windows RECT for
the Windows API and a PM RECTL for the equivalent PM API.  Hence, there
is really no getting around the matter.  Note especially the difference
between _wpi_setrectvalues and _wpi_setwrectvalues; and _wpi_getrectvalues
and _wpi_getwrectvalues.  For Windows, top < bottom is normal for a rectangle.
However, for PM bottom < top is normal for a rectangle.  Hence by switching
the values of top and bottom in the assignment, we guarantee that if top <
bottom in Windows, then bottom < top in PM.  It is recommended that
coordinates that are saved be stored in the windows format and then be
converted to PM coordinates before displaying or drawing.
.np
The WPI_RECT structure also has a sister WPI_POINT data type.  This is
defined as POINT in Windows and POINTL in PM.  This type should be used to
replace the POINT structure in the Windows code.  This will assure the user
that Windows APIs will use the POINT structure and PM ones, the POINTL
structure.  The fields of this structure are named the same (x and y);
however, the types for Windows are int and for PM, LONG.  While there is
a _wpi_setpoint macro in WPI, it is not essential to use it because of the
common field names.
.np
In addition, the following routines work with rectangles, points and
coordinates:
.begnote $setptnt 3
.note _wpi_getwidthrect( r )
.np
This will return the width of the rectangle.
.note _wpi_getheightrect( r )
.np
This will return the height of the rectangle.
.note _wpi_cvth_y( y, height )
.np
This will convert the value of y for a window in Windows coordinates to PM
coordinates.
Height is the height of the window and the new value is returned.
.note _wpi_cvth_pt( &pt, height )
.np
This converts the y value of a WPI_POINT in a window from Windows coordinates
to PM coordinates.
Height is the height of the window.
.note _wpi_cvth_rect(&rect, height)
.np
This converts the top and bottom values of a WPI_RECT from Windows coordinates
to PM coordinates.
Height is the height of the window and is assumed to be a LONG.
.note _wpi_cvth_wanchor( y, window_cy, parent_cy )
.np
This converts an anchor point (y) from Windows to PM coordinates.
The anchor point is the coordinates at which a window is displayed on the desk
top (top left for Windows and bottom left for PM).
All values are assumed to be LONG.
.note _wpi_cvts_y( y )
.np
This converts a value relative to the desktop in Windows coordinates to that
of PM.
The new value is returned (ie. same as _wpi_cvth_y except it is relative to
the desktop).
.note _wpi_cvts_pt( &pt )
.np
Same as _wpi_cvth_pt except that the point is assumed to be relative to the
screen (desk top window).
.note _wpi_cvts_rect( &rect )
.np
Same as _wpi_cvth_rect except that the values are assumed to be relative to
the screen (desk top window).
.note _wpi_cvts_wanchor( y, window_cy )
.np
Same as _wpi_cvth_wanchor except the anchor point is assumed to be relative
to the screen (desk top window).
Values are expected to be LONG.
.note _wpi_cvtc_y( hwnd, y )
.np
Same as _wpi_cvth_y except the routine only takes the window handle (it
calculates the window height).
The new value is returned and y is expected to be LONG.
.note _wpi_cvtc_rect( hwnd, &rect )
.np
Same as _wpi_cvth_rect except the routine calculates the window height itself.
.endnote
The _wpi_cvt* macros are used for converting coordinates between the two
target systems.
For PM, calling the macros once will convert the y values passed in from
Windows coordinates to the equivalent PM coordinates.
In some instances, coordinates may be stored differently for the different
platforms (for example when the coordinates are established by a detection
of a WM_MOUSEMOVE).
Be sure the _wpi_cvt* routines are only used when the values will be in
Windows coordinates.
For example, drawing a rectangle according to the coordinates determined from
a WM_MOUSEMOVE would not warrant a _wpi_cvt* call.
For Windows, these macros do not alter the y values.
The _wpi_cvt*_wanchor macros can be used to place a window on the desktop.
The point passed in can be in Windows coordinates and the macro will convert
the point to PM coordinates.
.*
.section Presentation Spaces and Device Contexts
.*
.np
PM has the concept of a presentation space which can be used to display
graphics.  However, the presentation space does not replace the notion of a
device context, because PM also has device contexts.  Since Windows does not
have a presentation space, a WPI_PRES has been introduced to allow the use
of presentation spaces.  For Windows, a WPI_PRES is simply an HDC and for PM
it is an HPS (presentation space handle).  The equivalent of creating a
memory device context in Windows is to create a memory presentation space.
In creating a compatible presentation space in PM, an HDC is required and
must be deleted.  WPI handles this.  Throughout this document the term
presentation space (or pres) is used and will refer to an HPS in PM and an
HDC in Windows.  Hence when phrases such as "drawing on a pres" arise, it
is implied that drawing is happening on an HPS in PM and an HDC in Windows.
Moreover, a compatible pres corresponds to a compatible HPS in PM and a
compatible (memory) HDC in Windows.  When HDC is refered to (unless
specifically for Windows) it will imply both HDC for Windows and HDC for PM.
.np
The following are some common macros used with presentation spaces and
device contexts:
.begnote $setptnt 3
.note _wpi_getpres( hwnd )
.np
This returns the presentation space associated with the window handle.
For Windows this is simply GetDC.
hwnd can be HWND_DESKTOP (which is the same as NULL).
.note _wpi_releasepres( hwnd, pres )
.np
This releases the presentation space associated with the given window.
In Windows this is a ReleaseDC.
.note _wpi_createcompatiblepres( pres, hab, &hdc )
.np
For PM this macro creates and returns a presentation space that is
compatible with the one given.
It also creates a device context which is required when deleting the
presentation space.
For normal drawing, the hdc is not used.
For Windows this simply performs a CreateCompatibleDC.
.note _wpi_deletecompatiblepres( mempres, hdc )
.np
This function deletes the presentation space and for PM, the device
context handle.
.endnote
Creating a compatible presentation space handle may appear a little confusing.
First, recall that the Windows steps to creating a compatible presentation
space are as follows:
.np
:XMP.
hdc = GetDC( hwnd );
 ...
memdc = CreateCompatibleDC( hdc );
        /*
         * Either draw on the memdc or the hdc
         */
 ...
ReleaseDC( hwnd, hdc );
 ...
DeleteDC( memdc );
 ...
:eXMP.
.np
When using WPI, a presentation space handle and a device context appear to
be created.  In Windows, the compatible DC is returned by the routine and
hdc is simply set to NULL (ie. it is not used).  When deleting the
compatible pres in Windows, nothing happens to the hdc parameter since it
has been set to NULLonly the compatible DC is deleted (stored in mempres).
In PM, the device context handle is only used when deleting the presentation
space handle.  Under both platforms, the pres parameter passed into
_wpi_createcompatiblepres must be valid and all drawing must take place on
the returned memory presentation space handle, or pres.  The equivalent to
the above example would be:
.np
:XMP.
pres = _wpi_getpres( hwnd );
 ...
mempres = _wpi_createcompatiblepres( pres, Instance, &hdc );
        /*
         * Either draw on pres or mempres
         */
 ...
_wpi_releasepres( hwnd, pres );
 ...
_wpi_deletecompatiblepres( mempres, hdc );
 ...
:eXMP.
.*
.section Graphics
.*
.np
In Windows, the graphics interface is known as the GDI (Graphics Device
Interface).  The equivalent in PM is the GPI (Graphical Programming
Interface).  The graphics interface includes objects such as pens, brushes,
fonts, bitmaps, palettes and presentation space attributes.
.np
In PM as in Windows, each presentation space has its own set of attributes.
When a presentation space is created, it has a default set of attributes
which are used unless they are specifically changed.  Among these attributes
are line, area, image, and character attributes.  Each of these attribute
types has a corresponding structure which contains fields to describe the
type.  PM provides APIs to change the values of the individual fields of the
attributes.  Also, there is a GpiSetAttrs API in which the attribute type
(line, area, etc.) must be specified and can be set.
.*
.section Colours
.*
.np
There is a slight difference between colours in Windows and PM.  In Windows,
colours are usually referenced by a COLORREF variable which contains an RGB
value.  Moreover, Windows APIs with a COLORREF parameter expect the variable
to be an RGB value.  This is not necessarily the case in PM.  In PM, a
presentation space can either be in index mode or RGB mode.  If a
presentation space is in RGB mode, all references are expected to be RGB
values.  However, this is NOT the default mode.  The default (index mode)
implies that all references to colours are indices into a colour table
associated with the presentation space.  When in index mode, all API
references to colours are expected to contain indices and when in RGB mode,
all APIs expect RGB values.  Attempting to use RGB values in index mode will
produce unpredictable results.  Furthermore, PM will interpret index values
as RGB values when in RGB mode.
.np
Since the user is converting from Windows to PM, their Windows code will
contain RGB colour values.  Since RGB is not the default mode, the user will
need to switch to RGB mode whenever RGB colour values are used in a newly
created presentation space.  The WPI macro _wpi_torgbmode(pres) will set the
given presentation space to RGB mode.  This macro does nothing in Windows.
A very easy mistake to make when converting code is to forget to set the
presentation space to RGB mode.
.np
WPI defines COLORREF to be ULONG for PM which is how colours are stored in
that environment.  Hence, the user can leave Windows COLORREF variables as
COLORREF variables (alternatively, they can declare colour variables as
WPI_COLOUR) in their converted code.  Moreover, the RGB macro used in
Windows to create an RGB value is also available with WPI in PM.
Occurrences like:  RGB(red, green, blue) need not change.
.*
.section Pens and Brushes
.*
.np
Windows includes the data types HPEN and HBRUSH which PM does not.  However,
through WPI, HPEN and HBRUSH can be used in PM.  In order to create and use
an HPEN or HBRUSH, WPI allocates memory for a structure which describes its
attributes.  When selecting an HPEN or HBRUSH into a presentation space,
space must be allocated to store the old pen or brush and the attributes of
the pen or brush being selected are set for the current pres.  Upon deleting
an HPEN or HBRUSH, WPI frees the memory it has allocated.  When a WPI
routine returns (or accepts as a parameter) an HPEN or HBRUSH, it is really
returning an address to the object structure (this address has been defined
as a WPI_HANDLE).
.np
Creating a pen using WPI is the same as creating a pen in Windows. Certain
attributes must be set such as the pen type (solid or dashed), the pen
thickness and the pen colour.  The _wpi_createpen macro accepts the same
parameters as Windows' CreatePen and returns the newly created pen. The pen
type should be specified using the Windows pen type definitions (these are
of the form PS_* and some types may not yet be converted in WPI).  After
allocating memory for the object structure, the PM routine sets the field
values of the structure as indicated by the parameters to the function
(the structure corresponding to an HPEN in PM is a LINEBUNDLE; however,
this should be invisible to the user).
.np
Similarly, brushes are created as they are in Windows.  The
_wpi_createsolidbrush, for example accepts the colour of the solid brush
and returns the brush being created.  Again, the PM version of the function
allocates memory for the object structure and then sets the fields of the
structure as indicated by the parameters to the function (the structure
corresponding to an HBRUSH in PM is an AREABUNDLE; again, this is
invisible to the user).
.np
Recall that both HPEN and HBRUSH are addresses of a object structures in PM.
Hence when a pen or brush is created, WPI allocates space for the structure
before setting the fields of the structure and returning a pointer to the
structure.  Naturally, when deleting an object WPI frees the memory
associated with the object.  Moreover, when selecting an object into a
presentation space, the normal Windows behaviour is to return the old object.
So WPI needs to allocate space for the old object and must know when to free
that memory.  To accomplish this, WPI uses alloca which allocates enough
space for the old object and the automatically frees the memory when the
routine selecting the object is exited.  By employing this method, most
Windows code is convertable by simply using the _wpi_selectobject routine.
The drawback to this method is that the old object returned from
_wpi_selectobject cannot be a global variable.  To accommodate this problem,
WPI also has the following routines:
.begnote $setptnt 3
.note _wpi_selectpen( pres, hpen )
.np
This routine selects the pen associated with hpen into the presentation space.
Space for the old pen is allocated and returned from the function.
The old pen can be global if necessary.
.note _wpi_getoldpen( pres, holdpen )
.np
This routine sets the presentation space attributes for the old pen and frees
the memory associated with the old pen.
.note _wpi_selectbrush( pres, hbrush )
.np
This routine is the same as _wpi_selectpen except for brushes.
.note _wpi_getoldbrush( pres, holdbrush )
.np
This routine sets the presentation space attributes for the old brush and
frees the memory associeated with the old brush.
.endnote
The difference between _wpi_selectobject and _wpi_selectpen cannot be
over-emphasized!  The points to consider when using _wpi_selectobject are:
.np
it is more generic (the same function selects pens, brushes, bitmaps, old
pens, old brushes etc...) and looks more like windows code
.np
the following code is possible because all old objects will be freed when myproc is exited:
.np
:XMP.
void myproc( void ) {
        oldpen = _wpi_selectobject( hpres, hpen1 );
        ...
        _wpi_selectobject( hpres, hpen2 );
        ...
        _wpi_selectobject( hpres, oldpen );
}
:eXMP.
.np
if the old object is a global variable, set in one routine and selected back
into the pres in another routine, _wpi_selectobject cannot be used because
alloca will free the memory when exiting the routine in which the old object
was created.
.np
The points to consider when using _wpi_selectpen or _wpi_selectbrush are:
.np
the old object returned from the select can be used as a global variable
because the select does a normal allocate (using _wpi_malloc) and the memory
will not be freed until a _wpi_getold*
.np
each _wpi_selectpen (or _wpi_selectbrush) must have a corresponding
_wpi_getoldpen before the next _wpi_selectpen for that presentation space
handle;  so the following code is not correct because memory for the second
_wpi_selectpen will never be freed:
.np
:XMP.
void myproc( void ) {
        oldpen = _wpi_selectpen( hpres, hpen1 );
        ...
        _wpi_selectpen( hpres, hpen2 );
        ...
        _wpi_getoldpen( hpres, oldpen );
}
:eXMP.
.np
One final note about selecting pens and brushes:  the routines are not
interchangable.  So if a pen has been selected with _wpi_selectobject the
old pen should be selected with _wpi_selectobject, not with _wpi_getoldpen!
Similarly, selecting a pen with _wpi_selectpen necessitates _wpi_getoldpen
to select the old pen back into the presentation space.
.np
Finally, deleting a pen or brush is similar to deleting the object in
Windows.  For PM, the WPI macro frees the space associated with the pointer
to the structure.  The following WPI routines handle creating and deleting
pens and brushes:
.begnote $setptnt 3
.note _wpi_createpen( type, width, colour )
.np
In Windows, this creates a pen with the specified pen style (PS_*), width
and colour.
In PM this  allocates space for the object structure and sets the type,
width and foreground colour for the pen.
The pen is returned by the function.
.note _wpi_createnullpen( )
.np
Creates and returns a NULL pen (ie. invisible pen).
Windows version simply gets the NULL stock pen.
.note _wpi_createnullbrush( )
.np
Creates and returns a NULL brush.
Windows version simply gets the NULL stock brush.
.note _wpi_createsolidbrush( colour )
.np
In Windows this returns a solid brush with colour colour.
In PM this allocates space for the object structure and sets the foreground
colour for the brush.
.note _wpi_createpatternbrush( bitmap )
.np
Returns a pattern brush using bitmap as the pattern.
.note _wpi_deletepen( pen )
.np
In Windows this deletes the pen object.
In PM this frees the memory associated with pen.
.note _wpi_deletebrush( brush )
.np
In Windows this deletes the brush object.
In PM this frees the memory associated with brush.
.note _wpi_deletenullpen( pen )
.np
For PM this deletes the NULL pen.
This does nothing in Windows.
.note _wpi_deletenullbrush( brush )
.np
For PM this deletes the NULL brush.
This does nothing in Windows.
.note _wpi_selectobject( pres, hobject )
.np
This routine selects a pen, brush or bitmap into the presentation space.
The PM version performs an alloca to allocate space for the old object which
is returned.
.endnote
There may be more functions than are presented here.  If the desired routine
does not appear in this list, search for it in wpi_os2.h and if it does not
exist, add it.  Here is a typical example of selecting pens and brushes into
a presentation space.
.np
Windows code:
.np
:XMP.
pen1 = CreatePen( PS_SOLID, 0, BLACK );
pen2 = CreatePen( PS_SOLID, 0, WHITE );
brush1 = CreateSolidBrush( RED );
 ...
oldpen = SelectObject( hdc, pen1 );
oldbrush = SelectObject( hdc, brush1 );
 ...
SelectObject( hdc, pen2 );
 ...
SelectObject( hdc, oldpen );
SelectObject( hdc, oldbrush );
DeleteObject( pen1 );
DeleteObject( pen2 );
DeleteObject( brush1 );
:eXMP.
.np
WPI code:
.np
:XMP.
pen1 = _wpi_createpen( PS_SOLID, 0, BLACK );
pen2 = _wpi_createpen( PS_SOLID, 0, WHITE );
brush1 = _wpi_createsolidbrush( RED );
 ...
oldpen = _wpi_selectobject( pres, pen1 );
oldbrush = _wpi_selectobject( pres, brush1 );
 ...
_wpi_selectobject( pres, pen2 );
 ...
_wpi_selectobject( pres, oldpen );
_wpi_selectobject( pres, oldbrush );
_wpi_deletepen( pen1 );
_wpi_deletepen( pen2 );
_wpi_deletebrush( brush1 );
:eXMP.
.np
If the old objects are global:
.np
:XMP.
pen1 = _wpi_createpen( PS_SOLID, 0, BLACK );
pen2 = _wpi_createpen( PS_SOLID, 0, WHITE );
brush1 = _wpi_createsolidbrush( RED );
 ...
Oldpen = _wpi_selectpen( pres, pen1 );
Oldbrush = _wpi_selectbrush( pres, brush1 );
 ...
_wpi_getoldpen( pres, Oldpen );
Oldpen = _wpi_selectpen( pres, pen2 );
 ...
_wpi_getoldpen( pres, Oldpen );
_wpi_getoldbrush( pres, Oldbrush );
_wpi_deletepen( pen1 );
_wpi_deletepen( pen2 );
_wpi_deletebrush( brush1 );
:eXMP.
.np
Notice that with a few exceptions, the code looks very similar to that of
Windows.  In general, pens and  brushes can be used the same way they are
in Windows.
.*
.section Bitmaps
.*
.np
The use of bitmaps is quite similar between Windows and PM.  Although both
platforms have an HBITMAP data type, WPI stores bitmaps as object structures
similar to HPENs and HBRUSHes.  Hence when a bitmap is created and a handle
returned, the returned value should not be used for pure PM code, but only
in WPI code.  For example, the return value from _wpi_createcompatiblebitmap
is an address to a structure describing the bitmap (this address is defined
as a WPI_HANDLE).  This return value (the WPI_HANDLE) can be passed to WPI
functions expecting a bitmap handle, but the return value should not be used
in PM specific code (because the return value is a WPI_HANDLE and not an
HBITMAP).
The bitmap data types declared in WPI are as follows:
.np
:XMP.
WPI Data Type   Windows Data Type   PM Data Type
-------------   -----------------   ------------
WPI_HBITMAP     HBITMAP             WPI_HANDLE
:eXMP.
.np
Like HPEN and HBRUSH, bitmaps can be selected into memory
presentation spaces with the _wpi_selectobject routine and the old bitmap
will be allocated and returned from the routine.  For example:
.np
:XMP.
oldbitmap = _wpi_selectobject( mempres, hbitmap );
 ...
_wpi_selectobject( mempres, oldbitmap );
:eXMP.
.np
Again, if the old bitmap is used outside the routine selecting the bitmap
into the space, _wpi_selectbitmap and _wpi_getoldbitmap can be used.  Note
once again that each _wpi_selectbitmap must have a corresponding
_wpi_getoldbitmap before another bitmap can be selected into the
presentation space.  So if the old bitmap was global the code would look
like:
.np
:XMP.
Oldbitmap = _wpi_selectbitmap( mempres, hbitmap );
 ...
_wpi_getoldbitmap( mempres, Oldbitmap );
:eXMP.
.np
The following WPI routines handle bitmaps:
.begnote $setptnt 3
.note _wpi_createcompatiblebitmap( pres, width, height )
.np
This routine returns a bitmap compatible with the given presentation space
(HDC for Windows) and having the specified dimensions.
.note _wpi_createbitmap( width, height, planes, bitcount, &bits )
.np
This routine returns a bitmap with the attributes given in the parameter list.
Like Windows, if bits is NULL then the bitmap is left uninitialized.
.note _wpi_deletebitmap(bmp)
.np
Deletes the given bitmap.
The bitmap must have been created by a WPI function.
.note _wpi_getbitmapbits( hbitmap, size, &bits )
.np
Performs the same action as the Windows GetBitmapBits.
The bitmap must be created by a WPI routine.
.note _wpi_setbitmapbits( hbitmap, size, &bits )
.np
Performs the same action as the Windows SetBitmapBits.
The bitmap must be created by a WPI routine.
.note _wpi_selectobject( hpres, hobj )
.np
This will select the bitmap (or pen or brush) into the presentation space.
For PM, the old bitmap gets space allocated for it and is returned.
It will be freed when the routine is exited.
.note _wpi_selectbitmap( hpres, hbitmap )
.np
This will select the bitmap into the presentation space.
In PM, space is allocated for the old bitmap handle (which is return) and
will not be freed until a call to _wpi_getoldbitmap.
.note _wpi_getoldbitmap( hpres, holdbitmap )
.np
This will select the old bitmap into the presentation space.
For PM this frees the memory associated with the old bitmap.
.endnote
This again, is merely a subset of the bitmap functions available in WPI.
Many other Windows APIs have been converted to WPI.
If the desired function is not present in this list then search wpi_os2.h.
.np
Mention should be made here of how monochrome bitmaps are converted to
colour bitmaps.  The user should read the section on BitBlt (Windows) and
GpiBitBlt (PM) to find out how the conversion is done for each platform.
Unfortunately Windows and PM perform in the opposite manner.  Windows
converts all white pixels (1's) in the monochrome bitmap to the destination
DC background colour and all black pixels (0's) in the monochrome bitmap
to the destination DC foreground colour.  PM converts all white pixels to
the destination presentation space foreground colour and black pixels to the
background colour.  Hence in WPI, a macro called _wpi_preparemono can be
used to prepare the destination background and foreground colours to allow
the user to copy a monochrome bitmap to a colour bitmap.  The macro is used
as follows:
.np
:XMP.
_wpi_preparemono( destpres, black_pixel_colour, white_pixel_colour );
:eXMP.
.np
This will allow the user to set the presentation space to its proper colours
for both platforms.  The Windows default DC attributes should be such that
a monochrome bitmap copied to a colour bitmap will in fact be a colour
bitmap appearing the same as the monochrome bitmap.  These default settings
cannot be assumed for PM.  Hence this macro should be used whenever copying
from a monochrome to a colour bitmap.
.np
A few new types have been declared in wpitypes.h that relate to bitmaps.
They are as follows and can be used to pass to some of the macros that
require different types for Windows and PM:
.np
:XMP.
WPI Data Type           Windows Data Type   PM Data Type
-------------           -----------------   ------------
WPI_BITMAP              BITMAP              PM1632_BITMAPINFOHEADER2
WPI_BITMAPINFO          BITMAPINFO          PM1632_BITMAPINFO2
WPI_BITMAPINFOHEADER    BITMAPINFOHEADER    PM1632_BITMAPINFOHEADER2
WPI_BMPBITS             LPSTR               PBYTE
:eXMP.
.np
Since the bitmap structures for 16 bit PM are different than that for 32 bit
PM, a file called pm1632.h handles the differences (pm1632.h will be
discussed later).  There are also functions available to retrieve bitmap
information:
.begnote $setptnt 3
.note _wpi_getbitmapparms(hbitmap, &cx, &cy, &planes, &bitcount, &bitspixel)
.np
Takes the bitmap handle and returns the information about the bitmap.
NULL can be passed to any parameters not desired.
The bitspixel parameter will always be set to 0 in PM because that information
is not available under PM.
.note _wpi_getbitmapstruct(hbitmap, &bitmap_info)
.np
This routine fills the bitmap_info structure (should be type WPI_BITMAP)
according to the attributes of the given bitmap handle.
This routine may be usefull when a structure is needed to pass to another WPI
routine.
.endnote
.*
.section Using WPI to Draw
.*
.np
Once pens, brushes and bitmaps have been selected into their proper
presentation spaces, drawing can begin.  Many of the Windows drawing
functions have been converted in WPI to provide functionality for PM.
While some of these routine are quite similar to the Windows versions,
others differ dramatically.  The following is a list of some of these
routines:
.begnote $setptnt 3
.note _wpi_moveto(pres, &pt)
.np
Moves to the point on pres indicated by pt.
.note _wpi_lineto(pres, &pt)
.np
Draws a line from the current position to the indicated point.
.note _wpi_setpixel(pres, x, y, colour)
.np
Performs the same as the Windows SetPixel routine.
.note _wpi_getpixel(pres, x, y)
.np
Performs the same as the Windows GetPixel.
.note _wpi_rectangle(pres, left, top, right, bottom)
.np
Draws a rectangle.
Note that top is both top in Windows and PM (ie not bottom in PM).
Hence _wpi_cvt* macros may prove useful before using this macro.
.note _wpi_ellipse(pres, left, top, right, bottom)
.np
Draws an ellipse inside the box implied by the dimensions.
Note again that top < bottom for Windows and top > bottom for PM is assumed.
.note _wpi_arc(pres, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4)
.np
Draws an arc (as it does in Windows) defined by the given points.
.note _wpi_bitblt(dest, x1, y1, cx, cy, src, x2, y2, rop)
.np
Identical to Windows BitBlt.
PM version assumes (x1, y1) is actually the bottom left corner of the area and
uses Windows predefined ROP codes.
.note _wpi_patblt(dest, x1, y1, cx, cy, rop)
.np
Identical to Windows PatBlt.
Same comments as _wpi_bitblt.
.note _wpi_stretchblt(dest, x1, y1, cx1, cy1, src, x2, y2, cx2, cy2, rop)
.np
Identical to Windows StretchBlt.
Same comments as _wpi_bitblt.
.endnote
Note the difference in the first two routines listed.
They take a WPI_POINT instead of x and y values.
It should also be emphasized that the rectangle and ellipse macros for PM
expect top > bottom.
This is important because of the way PM draws these images.
Windows draws up to but not including the right and bottom coordinates.
PM actually includes the right and bottom coordinates.
WPI attempts to handle this difference and in so doing, requires that top
actually be the top.
Note the difference between the Windows code and converted code in this example:
.np
Windows Code:
.np
:XMP.
Rectangle( hdc, 10, 0, 100, 50 );
:eXMP.
.np
WPI Code:
.np
:XMP.
top = 0;
bottom = 50;
// Assume height has been set to the height of pres
top = _wpi_cvth_y( 0, height );
bottom = _wpi_cvth_y( 50, height );
_wpi_rectangle( pres, 10, top, 100, bottom );
:eXMP.
.np
The user will be required to add the conversion of the height (depending on
the circumstances) in order to assure that top > bottom.  Currently,
ellipses are not drawn very accurately in PM.  This is due to the way in
which PM draws ellipses.  The most trouble occurs when the dimensions of
the bounding rectangle of the ellipse contain even values.  Work is
underway to rectify this problem.
.np
Since the blt functions take only an origin and then the width and height,
the origin is assumed to be in PM format for PM and Windows format for
Windows.  This is particularly useful in copying bitmaps since the origin
(0, 0) can be used under both platforms.
.*
.section Palettes
.*
.np
Currently, WPI does not support many palette operations.  The macro
_wpi_selectpalette(pres, hpal) will select a palette into the given
presentation space.  Moreover, the data type HPALETTE in PM is defined
to be HPAL.  If the code being converted contains references to palettes,
expect to make additions to WPI.
.*
.section Fonts
.*
.np
Fonts can be complicated objects to deal with in PM.  PM does not have
an HFONT data type nor a LOGFONT data type.  The font data types declared
in WPI are as follows:
.np
:XMP.
WPI Data Type   Windows Data Type   PM Data Type
-------------   -----------------   ------------
HFONT           HFONT               LONG
WPI_FONT        HFONTF              ATTRS*
WPI_LOGFONT     LOGFONT             FONTMETRICS
WPI_TEXTMETRIC  TEXTMETRIC          FONTMETRICS
:eXMP.
.np
In Windows, one can create a font and once a font handle is acquired, use
that font handle as a parameter (or any other kind of variable) to be
selected into a device context for text output.  However, creating a font
in PM requires a presentation space and once that presentation space is
released, the created font is gone.  So, a division arises between the two
cases. When a font is desired and a presentation space exists, the
following macros can be used:
.begnote $setptnt 3
.note _wpi_createfont(pres, &wlfont, &hfont)
.np
For Windows this is the same as CreateFontIndirect with wlfont as the logfont.
The font handle is returned in hfont.
For PM this creates a font from the specifed WPI_LOGFONT and returns the font
handle (the value:  1) in hfont.
The font can only be used in the given presentation space.
.note _wpi_getdeffm(wlfont)
.np
Sets the WPI_LOGFONT to its default values.
.note _wpi_deletefont(hfont)
.np
Deletes the font for Windows and resets the font identifier for PM.
.note _wpi_getsystemfont()
.np
Returns the system font for Windows and the default font identifier for PM.
.note _wpi_selectfont(pres, hfont, &oldfont)
.np
Selects the given font into the given presentation space.
.note _wpi_getoldfont(pres, oldfont)
.np
Selects the old font into the given presentation space.
.endnote
In addition to these macros, there are macros to set the font to italics,
bold, strikeout, and more.  Moreover, macros exist to set the font height,
width and pointsize.  Due to the number of macros available, they are not
all listed here.  To find the proper macro, search for _wpi_setfont in
wpi_os2.h until the required macro has been found.
.np
All of the above macros work with the HFONT data type.  They all assume that
text output will occur with the presentation space used in the macro calls.
However, there may be situations in which the user wishes to create a font
and use it with a presentation space created at a later time.  This is the
purpose of the WPI_FONT data type.  The following macros handle WPI_FONTs:
.begnote $setptnt 3
.note _wpi_createwpifont(&wlfont, wfont)
.np
Creates a WPI_FONT.
For Windows, this is the same as a normal font creation.
.note _wpi_selectwpifont(pres, wfont)
.np
Windows version selects the font into the DC.
PM allocates memory for the old font and sets the font of the given pres
to be that of wfont.
.note _wpi_getoldwpifont(pres, oldfont)
.np
Restores the font of pres to be the old font and frees the old font memory.
.note _wpi_deletewpifont(wfont)
.np
Deletes the font associated with wfont.
.endnote
A WPI_FONT for PM is actually a pointer.  The creation macro allocates space
for the structure on the PM platform and the deletion frees the space.
As with pens and brushes, selecting the font into the presentation space
allocates space for the old font structure so it is essential that the old
font be selected back into the presentation space to free the memory
associated with it.  A quick look at _wpi_selectwpifont for PM will show
that the font is actually being created in this routine.
This is because the font is always tied to the presentation space.  Once
again, before calling the creation macro, the user may use the
_wpi_setfont* macros to set the attributes of the desired font.
.*
.section Window Functions
.*
.np
There are some similarities between Windows window procedures and PM window
procedures and hence converting these is relatively straightforward.  The
format and main philosophy of windows procedures is the same on both
platforms and much is accomplished by simply defining a new set of types
or function names.
.*
.section Window APIs
.*
.np
Since many of the windows related functions differ only in name between the
two platforms, WPI allows the user to use the Windows name when calling the
API.  The following is a list of some of the window related macros and the
names available to the user:
.np
:XMP.
DefWindowProc(hwnd, msg, wp, lp)    _wpi_defwindowproc(hwnd, msg, wp, lp)
:eXMP.
Takes default window procedure action.
:XMP.
ShowWindow(hwnd, state)             _wpi_showwindow(hwnd, state)
:eXMP.
Shows the window according the given state.  Windows predefined states are used.
:XMP.
GetClientRect(hwnd, &wrect)         _wpi_getclientrect(hwnd, &wrect)
:eXMP.
Gets the rectangle dimensions of the given window.  The function fills the WPI_RECT variable.
:XMP.
DestroyWindow(hwnd)                 _wpi_destroywindow(hwnd)
:eXMP.
Destroys the given window.
:XMP.
SetWindowText(hwnd, str)            _wpi_setwindowtext(hwnd, str)
:eXMP.
Sets the caption of the given window.
:XMP.
MessageBox(hpar, txt, title, style) _wpi_messagebox(hpar, txt, title, style)
:eXMP.
Displays a message box as it does in Windows.  Most of the MB_* styles have been converted, using the Windows naming convention.
:XMP.
GetMenu(hwnd)                       _wpi_getmenu(hwnd)
:eXMP.
Gets the menu of the window.  For PM this window handle must be a frame window.
.np
The user may decide whether or not to keep the Windows names or use the
available WPI names.
.*
.section Window Creation
.*
.np
Window creation is somewhat different in PM than Windows.  The user may wish
to use separate PM code from their Windows code in order to gain clarity and
the flexibility when creating windows.  In WPI however, an attempt has been
made to convert the window creation routines.  The two main macros are
_wpi_registerclass and _wpi_createwindow.  The _wpi_createwindow routine may
prove useful for creating a standard window style, however it is limiting
in some areas including the fact that it will not allow initialization data
to be passed in the WM_CREATE message.  The user should examine this routine
to verify its usefulness for the situation at hand.
.*
.section Window Procedures
.*
.np
Window procedures are also similar in both Windows and PM.  Under the WPI
scheme, windows functions should be declared as follows:
.np
:XMP.
MRESULT CALLBACK WindowsProc( HWND hwnd,
                              WPI_MSG msg,
                              WPI_PARAM1 wparam,
                              WPI_PARAM2 lparam );
:eXMP.
.np
Most of the messages are similar in name and where they differ, the Windows
convention has been used.  The user should note that messages such as
WM_MOUSEMOVE that store coordinates will store the coordinates according to
the platform under which they are running (ie Windows will return the mouse
coordinates with the top left as the origin and PM with the bottom left as
the origin).
.np
When creating windows, PM does not specify the background colour of the
window.  This suggests that no default painting goes on when a PM window
procedure receives a WM_PAINT.  The user may be required to add the
following to their WM_PAINT messages:
.np
:XMP.
case WM_PAINT:
        _wpi_beginpaint( hps, NULL, &wrect );
        ...
#ifdef __OS2_PM__
        WinFillRect( hps, wrect, background_clr );
#endif
        ...
        _wpi_endpaint( hwnd, pres, &wrect );
:eXMP.
.*
.section Resources
.*
.np
&company. has its own resource compiler, so &company. does not require
the use of the OS2 toolkit resource compiler.
RC files in PM look similar to those of Windows.
The user should look at the PM help files or an available example in order
to convert their RC files.
.*
.section Dialogs
.*
.np
Dialogs, like other windows have some definite similarities between Windows
and PM.  Because of these similarities, a program has been created to
transform Microsoft Dialog Editor DLG files to PM DLG files.  This program
is called parsedlg.exe and can be found in r:\cmds.  To use this program simply type:
.np
parsedlg infile.dlg outfile.dlg
.np
The user will need to compile their PM application with the newly parsed DLG
file.  Note that this new dialog should look the same as the Windows dialog.
The user does not need to convert any coordinates.  One should also note
that in Windows a dialog can either be referenced by either a unique string
name or a unique integer (this gets passed into the DialogBox API).  In PM
however, a dialog box can be referenced only by a unique integer.  If
a string is currently used, the user will need to change this to an integer.
.np
Once the dialog file is parsed, the user can convert the code generating the
dialog procedure.  Initializing a dialog box procedure would look like the
following under WPI:
.np
:XMP.
fp = _wpi_makedlgprocinstance( DlgProc, Instance );
ret_val = _wpi_dialogbox( hparent, fp, Instance, DLG_ID, 0L );
_wpi_freedlgprocinstance( fp );
:eXMP.
.np
The dialog procedure itself looks much like a Windows dialog procedure
excluding the WPI conversion names:
.np
:XMP.
DLG_RESULT CALLBACK DlgProc( HWND hwnd,
                             WPI_MSG msg,
                             WPI_PARAM1 wparam,
                             WPI_PARAM2 lparam );
:eXMP.
.np
The user may continue to use the constants IDOK and IDCANCEL since they are
defined in WPI to be consistent with the constants used by the parsedlg.exe
program.  Unique to PM is the use of a default dialog procedure.  Where
Windows usually returns FALSE, PM returns WinDefDlgProc with the same
parameters as the procedure from which it is returned.  Hence the user will
want to return _wpi_defdlgproc(hwnd, msg, wparam, lparam) for unprocessed
dialog messages.  This will simply return FALSE for Windows.
.np
The following is an example of a dialog procedure for which there are a
number of tricky points between Windows and PM.  This is done to illustrate
some of the differences between Windows and PM as well as where to spot
trouble.
.np
:XMP.
WPI_DLGRESULT CALLBACK dlg_sample( HWND dlg_hld,
                                   WPI_MSG msg,
                                   WPI_PARAM1 parm1,
                                   WPI_PARAM2 parm2 )
{
    int                 initial_col;
    int                 tmp;

    if( msg == WM_INITDIALOG ) {

        /* PM expects a pointer to the data    */
        /* while Windows just expects the data */

#ifdef __OS2_PM__
        {
        int                     *ptr;
        ptr = (int *) parm2;
        initial_col = *ptr;
        }
#else
        initial_col = parm2;
#endif
        return( (WPI_DLGRESULT) TRUE );


        /* The following line is necessary because for PM */
        /* because some messages which are caught under   */
        /* WM_COMMAND in PM are not in Windows and vice   */
        /* versa.  Hence, use this routine to trap the    */

.section Owner-Drawn Controls
.*
.np
This section covers only buttons and listboxes since menus have not been
researched or tested.  There is some fully functioning code in the datactl
library (cf. Dan Pronovost).
.np
To begin with, owner-drawn buttons get drawn by responding to a WM_CONTROL
(WM_DLGCOMMAND) message while everything else should respond to a WM_DRAWITEM
message.  The following section of code illustrates how to determine what
type to draw:
.np
:XMP.
 ...
    _wpi_getcursorpos( &q_pt );
    _wpi_setanchorblock( hwnd, inst );
    time = _wpi_getcurrenttime( inst );
    _wpi_setqmsgvalues( &qmsg, hwnd, msg, parm1, parm2, time, q_pt );

    /*
     * make absolutely sure that any buttons handle the WM_QUERYDLGCODE
     * message and return DLGC_BUTTON
     */
    is_button = ((int)_wpi_sendmessage(hwnd, WM_QUERYDLGCODE, &qmsg, 0L)
                                                                           & DLGC_BUTTON);
    is_button = is_button &&
        ( SHORT2FROMMP( parm1 ) == BN_PAINT ) && ( msg == WM_DLGCOMMAND );

    if( is_button ) {
                .
                .
        < draw the button >
                .
                .
    } else if( msg == WM_DRAWITEM ) {
                .
                .
        < draw the listbox >
                .
                .
    }
                .
                .
:eXMP.
.np
Buttons are sent a USERBUTTON structure in the second parameter.  The
following section of code illustrates how to obtain information from this
structure:
.np
:XMP.
                .
                .
        USERBUTTON              *b2;

        b2 = (USERBUTTON *) parm2;
        win_hld = b2->hwnd;
        pres = b2->hps;
        id = SHORT1FROMMP( parm1 );
        tmp_word = LOWORD( b2->fsState );
        disabled = ( tmp_word == BDS_DISABLED );
        selected = ( tmp_word == BDS_HILITED );
        tmp_word = LOWORD( b2->fsStateOld );
        old_selected = ( tmp_word == BDS_HILITED );
        select_changed = ( selected == old_selected );
        has_focus = ( GetFocus() == win_hld );
        _wpi_getclientrect( win_hld, &rect );
                .
                .
        < draw the button based on above information >
                .
                .
        // tells the system you did the highlighting
        b2->fsStateOld = b2->fsState;

        // tells the system you drew the item
        to_ret = (WPI_DLGRESULT) TRUE;
                .
                .
:eXMP.
.np
Listboxes are sent an OWNERITEM structure in the second parameter.  The
following section of code illustrates how to obtain information from this
structure:
.np
:XMP.
                .
                .
        poi = (OWNERITEM *) parm2;
        win_hld = poi->hwnd;
        pres = poi->hps;
        id = poi->idItem;
        rect = poi->rclItem;
        disabled = !WinIsControlEnabled( win_hld, id );
        selected = poi->fsState;
        focus_changed = !( poi->fsState == poi->fsStateOld );
        select_changed = !focus_changed;
                .
                .
        < draw the listbox based on above information >
                .
                .

        // tells the system you did the highlighting
        poi->fsState = poi->fsStateOld = 0;

        // tells the system you drew the item
        to_ret = (WPI_DLGRESULT) TRUE;
                .
                .

.section Menus
.*
.np
Menus are handled in the WM_DRAWITEM message, similar to listboxes, and
also use the OWNERITEM structure but take advantage of the attribute and
old attribute fields (MIA_).  The following routines handle menu operations:
.begnote $setptnt 3
.note _wpi_getmenu( hwnd )
.np
This returns the handle of the menu.
Note that for PM, hwnd must be a frame window handle.
.note _wpi_getcurrentsysmenu( hwnd )
.np
Returns the current system menu for the given frame window handle.
.note _wpi_checkmenuitem( hmenu, id, fchecked, fby_pos )
.np
This checks a menu item identified by id.
The fchecked variable should be either TRUE or FALSE (whether the item should
be checked or unchecked) and by_pos indicates whether the id indicates the
position (TRUE) or the actual identifier.
.note _wpi_enablemenuitem( hmenu, id, fenabled, fby_pos )
.np
Similar to _wpi_checkmenuitem except it indicates whether the item should
be enabled (TRUE) or grayed (FALSE).
.endnote
Once again, this is only a subset of the available menu functions.
.*
.section Other Platform Considerations
.*
.np
There is a good possibility that the Windows program being converted to PM
has already been converted to 32 or 64 bit Windows (or will be converted to
32 or 64 bit Windows).  Furthermore, there is the possibility that a PM
application is desired for both 16 and 32 bit platforms.  These can produce
somewhat precarious situations;  however, there should not be too many
problems if the user is careful.  To begin with, wpitypes.h includes
wi163264.h if compiling for Windows and pm1632.h if compiling for PM.
These header files contain macros which translate between 16 and 32 and 64
bit Windows; and 16 and 32 bit PM.
.np
Where possible, if adding to WPI the user should be certain that the
Windows version will be compatible with wi163264.h and the PM version with
pm1632.h.  This means for example, that it may be appropriate for a WPI
macro on the Windows side to refer to another macro defined in wi163264.h.
.*
.section Adding To WPI
.*
.np
A few considerations should be made when modifying WPI.
.np
Note first of all that all references to malloc should use the _wpi_malloc
symbol since the user may decide to define their own memory allocating
routine.
.np
Remember that if a routine is changing there could be several parties
affected by the change.
.np
When adding routines, be sure to consider how the code may affect 32 or
64 bit Windows or may be different for 16 and 32 bit PM.  Be sure to check
wi163264.h and pm1632.h to make sure one of the contained macros is not
needed.  It is best after adding a routine to WPI to create the library for
all of 16 and 32 and 64 bit Windows, and 16 bit PM, and 32 bit PM, even if
you are not using all levels.
.np
One should be certain when adding macros to WPI that no size values are hard
coded. Whenever possible the sizeof operator should be used since structures
may be different sizes in 16 and 32 and 64 bit Windows; and 16 and 32 bit PM.
.np
When using macros be generous in the use of parentheses.  Bracket pointers
and structures in case expressions are passed to the macros.  In general,
if the macro requires more than 1 line of code or if the routine needs to
return a value, add the routine to the library.
