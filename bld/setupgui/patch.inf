# Patch Section Format
#
# (note:  Patch variable (in [Application] section) must be set to 1 
#     Directories can be referenced by an int or hardcoded into line
#     etc. dir could be 1, 2, or c:\wsql\h 
#
# patch, <source wpack file>, [ directory of file to be patched ], <destination file>
#           - default behaviour ( no dir specified ) is to
#             first look in DSTDIR, then search the system 
#             path for the file.
#
# copy, <source wpack file>, [ destination directory ] <destination file>
#           - default destination directory is DSTDIR
#
# delete, <file to be deleted>, [ directory of file to be deleted ]
#               - default directory is DSTDIR
# 

# examples:
# [Patch]
# patch, dbsrvt, win32, dbsrv50.exe
# copy, dbengt, win32, dbeng50.exe 
# delete, dbstopw.exe, win32

[Patch]
delete, dbstopw.exe, win32
copy, dbengt, win32, dbeng50.exe

[End]
