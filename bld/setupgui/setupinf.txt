Open Watcom Setup Program Install Script Description  (2nd draft)
====================================================

This installer was originally used by Watcom and later Sybase for deployment
of their products such as Watcom C/C++ and FORTRAN, VX-REXX (for OS/2) or
Watcom SQL (later Sybase SQL Anywhere). The installer was used on DOS,
Windows 3.x, Windows 9x, Windows NT and OS/2. A Unix (Linux) build of the
installer is also available. Character mode (console) versions are available,
as well as GUI versions for Windows and OS/2.

The install script is by default named setup.inf. This .inf file is divided
into sections, each section preceded by a section name enclosed in square
brackets, e.g. [Application]. Other than section headings, the script file
must consist of empty lines or lines whose content depends on the section.

Leading and trailing spaces are ignored. Lines starting with the hash
sign '#' are treated as comment lines. If a line ends in a backslash '\',
it is continued on the next line.


Variables
---------
   Variables have a name and a value. Each time a variable is set in a script
   it is overwritten, except for variables whose name starts with a '$':
   These retain their original value.

  Magic variables
   FullInstall         If set, all non-magic variables are true
   FullCDInstall       If set, all non-magic variables are true
                       with the exception of "HelpFiles" variable
   UnInstall           If set, all non-magic variables are false
   MinimalInstall      If set, make all file variables false
   SelectiveInstall
   PreviousInstall

  Nonmagic variables
   IsDos
   IsOS2
   IsOS2DosBox
   IsWin
   IsWin32
   IsWin64
   IsWin32s
   IsWin95
   IsWin98
   IsWinNT
   IsWinNT40
   IsWin2000
   IsLinux32
   IsLinux64
   IsAlpha
   HelpFiles
   SrcIsCD

 The nonmagic variables are pre-set automatically by the installer. The 'IsX'
variables are set if 'X' is the platform the installer is running on. The
SrcIsCD is set when the install source is a CD; currently, the installer
checks for the existence of a file named 'cd_source' in the same place where
setup.inf is located, but the SrcIsCD may be overridden by the setup script. 

Conditions
----------
   A condition is an boolean expression that evaluates to true or false.
   Conditions currently cannot be longer than 128 bytes (variable MAXBUF
   in setupinf.h).
    Conditions consist of one or more variable names plus operators. The
   expressions employ Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), that is, use a postfix
   notation. The available operators are:
   &   AND     previous two values
   |   OR      previous two values
   !   NOT     previous value
   ?   exist   previous value (must be a file name)

   The default operator (used if no operator is specified) is AND. Examples:

   cond1 cond2             evaluates as     cond1 AND cond2
   cond1 cond2 |           evaluates as     cond1 OR cond2
   cond1 cond2 ! |         evaluates as     cond1 OR (NOT cond2)
   cond1 cond2 cond3 |     evaluates as     cond1 AND (cond2 OR cond3)


Sections
--------
[Application]
   This defines global information for a product. Only one keyword is
   defined. Typically, global script variables are defined/set here.
   Theis section can appear multiple times in the script, for instance to
   define additional variables. But per script the latest DefPMGroup will
   be in effect. [what's this sudden talk about DefPMGroup?]

  DefPMGroup=wcpp32.grp, Watcom C_C++, %DstDir%\watcom.ico
   Defines the global PM (Windows Program Manager) group. The first value
   is the group file name, the second is the group name, the optional third
   is the group's icon file.

  $<var>=<value>
   If variable <var> doesn't exist yet, create global variable <var> with
   value <value>. Do nothing if <var> already exists.

  <var>=<value>
   Set variable <var> to value <value>, create the variable if needed.


[Autoexec]
   This section defines modifications to be made to autoexec.bat file only.

   The form is:

   <varname>=<value>,<cond>

   The format is variable name, followed by an '=', then the value terminated
   by a comma, then a condition. If the variable is preceded by a '+' sign,
   the value is appended to the end of any existing variable. 
   If the variable is preceded by a '++' sign, the value is appended to 
   the begin of any existing variable, else the variable is simply set.

[AutoSet]
   Defines conditional variables, with a variable name and a condition.
   Example:

   tools16=IsDos IsOS2 IsWin | |


[Config]
   This section defines modifications to be made to config.sys file only.

   The form is:

   <varname>=<value>,<cond>

   The format is variable name, followed by an '=', then the value terminated
   by a comma, then a condition. If the variable is preceded by a '+' sign,
   the value is appended to the end of any existing variable. 
   If the variable is preceded by a '++' sign, the value is appended to 
   the begin of any existing variable, else the variable is simply set.
   
   Example:

   FILES=20,IsDOS IsWin |

   The Config section is very similar to the Autoexec section.


[DeleteFiles]
   This defines which dialogs, directories or files should be deleted. Each of
   the three possible keywords 'dialog', 'file' or 'directory' is followed by
   a value giving the name of the dialog , file or directory to delete.
   Examples:

   dialog=FoundMFC21
   file=%DstDir%\binnt\mfc.hlp
   directory=%DstDir%\src\mfc\v21

   [I don't think this is right - the dialog will ask user if the files
   should really be deleted??]


[Dialog]
   This section defines a dynamically constructed dialog to provide feedback
   to user as well as facilitate user input. A dialog section must have only
   lines of the form 'keyword=value'. The following keywords are valid in
   a Dialog section

  name=<dlgname>
     Start a new dialog with the name <dlgname>. The dialog is referred to
     in other parts of setup script through this name.

  condition=<cond>
     Define one or more conditions under which this dialog will be displayed
     A condition is a variable name which is true or not. The condition
     can be negated by following the name with a space and an exclamation
     mark '!'

  title=<text>
     Use the specified <text> as title for the dialog

  any_check

  width=<num>
     Set the dialog text wrap width to <num> characters

  vis_condition=<cond>
     Set the visibility condition. For explanation see "condition" above.

  Dialog controls.

    Most of controls have optional condition and visibility condition values
      append to the end of each control specification.

  static_text="<text>"[,<cond>[,<visib.cond>]]
     Add a static text control to the dialog. If no text is following the '='
     sign, and empty line is added, which is useful to add padding in
     dialogs. The character '@' in static text is replaced by the name of
     the installtion program (e.g. 'SETUP' or 'INSTALL'). Note that the text
     must be enclosed in quotes.

  dialog_text="<text>"[,<cond>[,<visib.cond>]]
  dialog_text="@filename"[,<cond>[,<visib.cond>]]

  dynamic_text=FormattedDiskInfo,""[,<cond>[,<visib.cond>]]

  other_button="&Target...",Target,"Target operating systems:"[,<cond>[,<visib.cond>]]
     Add a selection button. It needs 3 command separated values. The first
     is the button label, and an '&' before a letter indicates a keyboard
     shortcut (button will be activated if Alt+letter is pressed). The second
     value is the name of a dialog that will be invoked if the button is
     activated. The third value is the explanatory text.

  edit_button variable_name,..?..[,<cond>[,<visib.cond>]]

  push_button=-"&Previous..."[,<cond>[,<visib.cond>]]
  push_button=.+"&OK"[,<cond>[,<visib.cond>]]
  push_button=?"&Help"[,<cond>[,<visib.cond>]]
  push_button=^"&Cancel"[,<cond>[,<visib.cond>]]

  radio_button=ModNow,1,"&Make all the modifications for you"[,<cond>[,<visib.cond>]]
     Define a radio button. It is followed by three values: a variable name,
     an initial value (1 or 0), and an explantory text. & in front of a letter
     of the text will activate the button (set the variable to 1) if
     Alt-letter is pressed. Of multiple radiobuttons, only 1 will be set to
     1, all other will be 0.

  check_box=CfgFileCreate,1,"&Create the file"[,<cond>[,<visib.cond>]]
     Define a check box. It is followed by three values: a variable name,
     an initial value (1 or 0), and an explantory text. & in front of a letter
     of the text will activate the button (toggle the variable between 0 and 1) if
     Alt-letter is pressed. A checkbox is not influenced by other checkboxes in
     the same dialog.

  check_box_continue
     Like check_box, but placed after it on the same line rather than below
     the previous checkbox.

  detail_check=dwin32sdk,"&Win32 SDK...",win32sdk,,"32-&bit Windows SDK"[,<cond>[,<visib.cond>]]

  edit_control=SrcDir,,"Source Directory:"[,<cond>[,<visib.cond>]]
     Get a value form the user. It is followed by 3 values: a variable name, an
     optional initial value, and a explanatory text.

  text_window=<height>,<text>[,<cond>[,<visib.cond>]]
     Define a multi-line text control, <height> lines tall, shown if
     <cond> is true. The text will be word wrapped to fit. The
     text_window control will typically be very wide, unless the width is
     limited via the 'width' keyword. If <text> starts with an '@' sign
     followed by a file name, then text is read from the external file
     (searched for in the current directory). Example:

     text_window=5,"@readme.txt",true

     Display a text control 5 lines tall, read input text rom 'readme.txt',
     and always show this control.


[Dirs]
   Defines the target directories used by the installed product. Each line
   lists one directory. The directories are internally sequentially numbered,
   starting with 1 for the first directory in the install script. The directory
   numers are referenced later in the Files section. Each line has three
   values. e.g. :

   binp\dll,1,8

   The first value is the directory name, the second is the target (??),
   the third is the parent. This parent is the number of the directory
   under which this particular directory resides. In the example, "binp"
   would have been the 8th directory line. If the parent is "-1", then ??


[Disks]
   This section defines the names of the disks on which the software is
   supplied. Each line names one disk, e.g. "Disk 1". Used primarily for
   floppy installs.


[End]
   This is the final section which terminates the install script.


[Environment]
   This section defines modifications to be made to the environment. 

   Behaviour is host specific:

   DOS, WIN - modify Autoexec.bat file and create batch file for environment setup.
   NT       - modify registry and create batch file for environment setup.
   OS/2     - modify Config.sys file and create batch file for environment setup.
   LINUX    - create batch file for environment setup.

   The form is:

   <varname>=<value>,<cond>

   The format is variable name, followed by an '=', then the value terminated
   by a comma, then a condition. If the variable is preceded by a '+' sign,
   the value is appended to the end of any existing variable. 
   If the variable is preceded by a '++' sign, the value is appended to 
   the begin of any existing variable, else the variable is simply set.

   Example:

   +INCLUDE=%DstDir%\H,IsWin95
   ++INCLUDE=%DstDir%\H,IsWin95
   INCLUDE=%DstDir%\H,IsWin95

   If 'IsWin95' is true, add '%DstDir%\H' to 'INCLUDE' environment variable,
   or add 'INCLUDE' if it didn't already exist. Note that '%DstDir% will be
   replaced with the actual value of 'DstDir' script variable.

   First example add '%DstDir%\H' as last item to the INCLUDE.
   Second example add '%DstDir%\H' as first item to the INCLUDE.
   Third example replace INCLUDE by '%DstDir%\H'.


[ErrorMessage]
   The ErrorMessage section serves primarily to ease translation of installer
   text. It provides a mechanism to externally store text for messages used
   by the installer. The format is

   <msgid>=<text>

   where <msgid> is a message identifier and <text> is the actual text to be
   displayed. The text may contain printf() style format specifiers. Example:

   IDS_ADD_TO_VAR="add the following to the '%s' variable"

   For full list of messages, see the ErrorMessage section in templat1.inf.


[Files]
   Defines a list of files to be installed. This is done in the form of
   'archive' lines, frequently split over multiple lines with the
   continuation character '\', where each archive file contains one or more
   file, directory and disk references, file type and optional conditions
   under which the archive should be processed. Example of a complete archive
   line:

   pck00659,1,tools.ini!1!e6w01s!!s,6,-1,4,.,wnttarg

   The first field (string) is the name of the archive, the second is the
   number of files in the archive in base-36 notation (symbols 0-9 and a-z).
   Following are as many file specifications as there are files in the
   archive, separated by a comma, and the archive entry is completed by five
   additional fields. The entire archive line is thus split into
   comma-separated sections, and within each of the one or more file sections
   the values are separated by an exclamation mark '!'. Example of a file
   specification within an archive line:

   tools.ini!1!e6w01s!!s

   Detailed description of the file specification follows. The first field
   (string) is the file name (note - if the extension is '.nlm' the file is
   flagged internally). The second field is the base-36 file size in 512 byte
   blocks (ie. disk sectors). The third (optional) field is the base-36 file
   'last modified' date (time_t value as returned by stat()'s st_mtime); if
   this field is empty, the date from the .inf file is used. The fourth
   (optional) value (string) is a variable name which will be created if
   needed and associated with the file. The fifth (optional) value (character)
   is an additional indicator, a single letter: If 's', it is supplemental; 
   if 'k', it is a core component.

   Following is the trailing part of an archive entry. Example:

   6,-1,4,.,wnttarg

   The first field is the base-36 index of the directory into which the
   file(s) should be placed. The second field is the base-36 "old directory"
   index: It is used when a file moved from one directory to another between
   releases; value of -1 indicates there is no previous directory. The third
   field is the base-36 disk index. The fourth field is the file type, which
   can be '1', 'm' or '$' (?? possibly to do with if a file is split over
   multiple diskettes, where '1' is the first part, 'm' is an intermediate
   part and '$' is the last part). If not specified, it is a single-part file.
   This is used to calculate file sizes. The fifth field (string) specifies a
   condition (in a format described above in the 'Conditions' section). This
   condition must be true for an archive to be processed.


[ForceDLLInstall]
   This doesn't seem to work looking at the code. An extra define
   (EXTRA_CAUTIOUS_FOR_DLLS) is needed for the code to activate. Its purpose
   might have been to force installation even if some paths etc don't match.
   TBS


[Labels]
   This is used in OS/2 only to add long name label to directories using
   the extended attributes. The format is:

   <dirname>=<label>


[LicenseMessage]
   Maps a variable name to strings. The variable names are fixed values
   inside the setup program. The format and purpose is similar to the
   ErrorMessage section (see ErrorMessage section description for details).


[MiscMessage]
   Maps a variable name to strings. The variable names are fixed values
   inside the setup program.


[Patch]
   Defines patches.

  copy
     Copy has four values, respectively source file name, destination
     directory, destination file name, and condition.

  patch
     Patch has five values, respectively source file name, destination
     directory, destination file name, exec type, and condition.

  delete
     Delete has three values, respectively destination file name,
     destination directory, and condition.

  mkdir
     MkDir has two value, destination directory and condition.


[PM Info]
   Defines whether a GUI folder/group will be populated with icons and
   shortcuts to installed files or folders. There are two kinds of entries:
   those where first word is 'GROUP' (case-sensitive), and which define a
   new group; and other lines, which specify a file (icon) to be added to
   the group. Each line has comma-separated values. The first two parameters
   are treated differently for group and file.

  GROUP, wpp32hlp.grp, Watcom C_C++ Tools Help,,, DoCreateHelpIcons IsFortranInstall !
     The first parameter is the group indicator
     The second is the group file name

  view.exe, c_readme.inf, Getting Started,,, IsOS2 DoCreateHelpIcons IsFortranInstall !
     The first parameter is the file name, e.g. executable program name
     such as 'notepad.exe', or .hlp file name, or text file name etc.
     The second (optional) parameter is passed as parameters to the first
     item, if it is an executable.

     The third is a description/name of the item
     The optional fourth is the icon file name, which must b present in the
     Files section.
     The optional fifth is the numeric icon position within the file, if
     there are multiple in the file. Only used on Windows.
     The sixth parameter is a condition.


[Profile]
   Defines profile information. 3 examples are given.

  386Enh, *device, %DstDir%\binw\wdebug.386, system.ini, , IsWin IsWin95 | ?%DstDir%\binw\wdebug.386
  boot, +drivers, winmm16.dll, system.ini, , IsWin UnInstall ! win32s
  Help,LocalHelp1,%HDir%\binnt,Software\Microsoft\MFC 3.0 Help,current_user,IsWin32 UnInstall !

     The first parameter is the application name.
     The second the key name. If it starts with a '+' it adds (during install) or deletes (uninstall)
     the value from the key's existing value, which is a space-separated string of values. If it
     starts with an '*', it adds or deletes a device entry to the file (line: device=value).
     The third is the key value.
     The next parameters are optional but no preceding once may be omitted, e.g. if you need the
     last one you need to supply all; but that may be done by supplying a space.
     The fourth is a filename, e.g. the ini file. This can the the name of an OS/2 binary .ini
     file like user.ini, of a text based win.ini style file where lines starting with a '['
     define an application and the lines after that the keys belonging to that application.
     The fifth a hive name (used on windows only), which may have the values "local_machine",
     "current_user" or anything else which is treated as "local_machine" as well. If the hive_name
     is given, the Windows registry is updated.
     The sixth a condition.


[Restrictions]
   Defines conditional variables which must be either true or false. Each
   line in the section must be of the form

   <var>=<value>

   where <value> is either 'true' or 'false', and <var> is a variable name.
   The variable will be created if needed.


[SetupErrorMessage]
   Maps message identifiers to text. See ErrorMessage section for details.


[Spawn]
   Runs an external program conditionally. Each line has three parts. The
   first is a keyword which is one of 'end', 'after' or anything else which
   is treated as 'before'. Then there are two values separated by a comma:
   the first is the program to run, the second the condition(s) under which
   it should run. Example:

   after=cmd.exe /c detach %CDDir%\binp\nmpbind.exe, SrcIsCD IsOS2


[StatusLineMessage]
   Maps message identifiers to text. See ErrorMessage section for details.


[Targets]
   Defines target directories. The directory variable name may be followed
   by a comma and the word 'supplimental' (which is a misspelling). Example:

  DstDir
  windir,supplimental


[Upgrade]
    Used for products that are sold as upgrade, either to previous version
    of the same product or as a "competitive upgrade". The Upgrade section
    contains a simple list of partial pathnames that the system will search
    for, for instance

   bin\msvc.exe
