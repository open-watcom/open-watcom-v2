		Modifications to DIP interface
		==============================
		
		
    void DIPMapInfo( mod_handle );
    
	- removed second parameter (DIPCliMapAddr passes mod_handle instead).
	
    
    void DIPCliMapAddr( addr_ptr *, mod_handle );
    
    	- second parameter changed from void * to mod_handle.
	
	
    dip_status DIPUnmapInfo( mod_handle );
    
    	- new routine. Take the given mod_handle and unmap all the symbolic
	  information. The client can then do another DIPMapInfo on the
	  image to move the addresses to new locations. A DIP implementation
	  may choose to return DS_FAIL to indicate that it does not support
	  this request. In this case the client should do DIPUnloadInfo 
	  followed by a DIPLoadInfo/DIPMapInfo. 
	  
	  
    dip_status TypeInfo( type_handle *, location_context *, type_info *,
    				type_info_need );
				
	    - added type_info_need parameter. Definition follows:
	    
	    	typedef enum {
		    TIN_KIND 	= 0x01,
		    TIN_MODIFER = 0x02,
		    TIN_SIZE	= 0x04,
		    TIN_ALL	= 0xff
		} type_info_need;
		
	        This bitset indicates what portions of the type_info
		structure are required to be filled in. A DIP implementation
		may choose to not fill in fields whose bits are not on if
		it's more efficient.
		
		
    dip_status TypeArrayInfo( type_handle *, location_context *, array_info *,
    				type_handle *, array_info_need );
				
	- added array_info_need parameter. Definition follows:
	
		typedef enum {
		    AIN_LOW_BOUND	= 0x01,
		    AIN_NUM_ELTS	= 0x02,
		    AIN_STRIDE		= 0x04,
		    AIN_NUM_DIMS	= 0x08,
		    AIN_COLUMN_MAJOR	= 0x10,
		    AIN_ALL	= 0xff
		} array_info_need;
		
	        This bitset indicates what portions of the array_info
		structure are required to be filled in. A DIP implementation
		may choose to not fill in fields whose bits are not on if
		it's more efficient.
		
		
    dip_status SymInfo( sym_handle *, location_context *, sym_info *,
    			sym_info_need );
			
	- added sym_info_need parameter. Definition follows:
	
		typedef enum {
		    SIN_KIND		= 0x0001,
		    /* for global,member,compiler,private,public,thunk */
		    SIN_BITS		= 0x0002,
		    SIN_RTN_FAR		= 0x0004,
		    SIN_RTN_CALLOC	= 0x0008,
		    SIN_RET_MODIFIER	= 0x0010,
		    SIN_RET_SIZE	= 0x0020,
		    SIN_NUM_PARMS	= 0x0040,
		    SIN_RET_ADDR_OFFSET	= 0x0080,
		    SIN_PROLOG_SIZE	= 0x0100,
		    SIN_EPLIOG_SIZE	= 0x0200,
		    SIN_RTN_SIZE	= 0x0400,
		    SIN_ALL		= 0xffff
		} sym_info_need;
		
	        This bitset indicates what portions of the sym_info
		structure are required to be filled in. A DIP implementation
		may choose to not fill in fields whose bits are not on if
		it's more efficient.

		
    add "thunk" field to the sym_info structure. It's on if the
    symbol is a piece of thunk code.
    
    
    dip_status DIPThunkInfo( sym_handle *, address * )
    dip_status DIPImpThunkInfo( imp_image_handle *, imp_sym_handle *,
    				address * )
				
    	- new routine(s). Given an sym_handle that refers to a "thunk"
	  routine, return the address of the routine that it's thunking
	  to.
		
		    
    remove SN_EXPRESSION from the symbol_name enumeration.
    
    
    search_result DIPImpAddrMod( imp_image_handle *, address *, 
    			imp_mod_handle *, unsigned_32 * )
			
	- changed second parameter from "address" to "address *". On input,
	  is address to be searched for. On output it is the first address
	  for the module in the range that contains the input address.
	  
    	- added final "unsigned_32 *" parameter. On output it contains the
	  length of the range of addresses that contains the search 
	  address.
