/**********************************************************************
 * TODO:
 *
 * Walk the list of symbols. There can be a number of sources
 * of symbol lists. What kind you're walking is determined by the
 * 'ss' parameter. It can take on the following values:
 *
 * SS_MODULE:
 *         The 'source' is a pointer to an imp_mod_handle. If
 *         the *(imp_mod_handle *)source is IMH_NOMOD, The list is
 *         all the module scope/global symbols in the image, otherwise
 *         it is the list of module scope/global symbols in the
 *         indicated module.
 *
 * SS_SCOPED:
 *         The 'source' is a pointer at an address. Considering the
 *         point of execution to be *(address *)source, the list
 *         is all the lexically scoped symbols visible from that
 *         point.
 *
 * SS_TYPE:
 *         The 'source' is a pointer to an imp_type_handle. If
 *         *(imp_type_handle *)source represents an enumerated
 *         type, the list is all the constant symbols of the
 *         enumeration. If the type handle represents a structure
 *         type, the list is all the field names in the structure.
 *
 *         When walking structures with a inherited classes, there is
 *         a small trick. Just before starting to walk the fields
 *         of an inherited class, the DIP should do a:
 *
 *                 wk( iih, SWI_INHERIT_START, NULL, d )
 *
 *         This indicates to client that an inherited field list
 *         is about to be started. If the client wishes the DIP to
 *         actually walk the inherited list, it will return WR_CONTINUE.
 *         If it wants you to skip the inherited fields it will return
 *         WR_STOP. You should continue with the reminder of the fields
 *         in the current structure that you're walking.
 *         When you come to the end of the list of members for an
 *         inherited class do a:
 *
 *                 wk( iih, SWI_INHERIT_END, NULL, d )
 *
 * SS_BLOCK:
 *         The 'source' is a pointer to a scope_block structure.
 *         Walk all the symbols in that lexical block _only_.
 *
 * SS_SCOPESYM:
 *         The 'source' is a pointer to an imp_sym_handle.
 *         This is a request to walk all the symbols in the
 *         scope identified by the imp_sym_handle. For example, if
 *         the imp_sym_handle is of type SK_NAMESPACE, walk all the
 *         symbols contained in that namespace.
 *
 * PSEUDO-CODE:
 *
 * for( each symbol in the list ) {
 *     if( starting new inherited base class ) {
 *         if( wk( iih, SWI_INHERIT_START, NULL, d ) != WR_CONTINUE ) {
 *             skip it and continue with next field in current class
 *         }
 *     } else if( ending list of inherited base class ) {
 *         wk( iih, SWI_INHERIT_END, NULL, d );
 *     } else {
 *         *ish = fill in symbol handle information;
 *         wr = wk( iih, SWI_SYMBOL, ish, d );
 *         if( wr != WR_CONTINUE ) {
 *             return( wr );
 *         }

 *
 * SS_MODULE:
 *         The 'source' is a pointer to an imp_mod_handle.
 *         Search all the file scope symbols in that module.
 *         If *(imp_mod_handle *)source is IMH_NOMOD, Search all file

 *         point of execution to be *(address *)source, search all
 *         the lexically scoped symbols visible from that point.
 *
 * SS_TYPE:
 *         The 'source' is a pointer to an imp_type_handle. If
 *         *(imp_type_handle *)source represents an enumerated
 *         type, search all the constant symbols of the

 * SS_BLOCK:
 *         Will never happen.
 *
 * SS_SCOPESYM:
 *         The 'source' is a pointer to an imp_sym_handle. Find symbols
 *         only in the scope identified by the 'source' pointer.
 *
 * The 'li' identifies the symbol name being looked up. It contains the
 * following fields:
 *
 * mod_handle              mod;
 *         Inside the implmentation, this field is actually an
 *         'imp_mod_handle'. If 'mod' is not IMH_NOMOD, then the symbol
 *         must be in the indicated module. If it is IMH_NOMOD, the
 *         symbol can be from any module in the image.
 *
 * lookup_token    name;
 *         The name of the symbol being looked up. A lookup_token
 *         contains a pointer to the start of the name and a length.
 *
 * lookup_token    scope;
 *         The C++ scope of the name. E.g., in the symbol "foo::bar",
 *         this field would indicate "foo". Yeah, I know that you
 *         can have more than one scope name, but I don't want to think
 *         about it until someone complains. If the start pointer in
 *         the lookup_token is NULL, then there is no scope name.
 *         Deprecated - new clients will use SS_SCOPESYM instead.
 *         Eventually support for this will be removed.
 *
 * lookup_token    source;
 *         This is the source name of the symbol being looked up. I.e.
 *         what the user typed in. It differs from the name field in
 *         that the client might try munging the symbol name to deal
 *         with the compiler adding characters to the front or end of
 *         the symbol name before writing it to the object file. E.g.
 *         The 'source' might be "foo", while the 'name' field is
 *         "foo_".
 *
 * unsigned                file_scope      : 1;
 *         If true, the symbol must be defined at file scope. E.g., in
 *         C++ terms, the user typed "::bar".
 *
 * unsigned                case_sensitive  : 1;
 *         If true, string comparisons are case sensitive. Otherwise,
 *         case insensitive.
 *
 * unsigned                type            : 4;
 *         This field can have the following values:
 *             ST_NONE
 *                 Normal everyday joe-blow symbol.
 *             ST_OPERATOR
 *                 C++ operator symbol. E.g. "operator +".
 *                 Note: In this case the name field would be "+".
 *             ST_DESTRUCTOR
 *                 C++ destructor. E.g. "~foo".
 *                 Note: In this case the name field would be "foo".
 *             ST_TYPE
 *                 A typedef name.
 *             ST_STRUCT_TAG
 *                 A structure tag. E.g. "struct mas".
 *                 Note: The name field would just be "mas".
 *             ST_CLASS_TAG
 *                 A class tag. E.g. "class mas".
 *                 Note: The name field would just be "mas".
 *             ST_UNION_TAG
 *                 A union tag. E.g. "union mas".
 *                 Note: The name field would just be "mas".
 *             ST_ENUM_TAG
 *                 A enum tag. E.g. "enum mas".
 *                 Note: The name field would just be "mas".
 *
 * The DIP should search in the indicated locations for the
 * indicated symbol. Since more than one symbol may match the
 * criteria due to C++ function overloading, a pointer to an
 * imp_sym_handle is not passed as a parameter to be filled in.
 * Instead, when the DIP finds a symbol that matches the lookup
 * parameters it should do the following call:
 *
 *         ish = DCSymCreate( iih, d );
 *
 * Where 'iih' and 'd' are the parameters that were passed into
 * the DIPImpLookupSym functions. If the client returns NULL, the
 * sym handle could not be created for some reason and the DIP
 * should terminate the symbol lookup and return SR_FAIL. If the
 * return is non-NULL then it is a pointer to a freshly minted
 * imp_sym_handle which the implementation should fill in with
 * the appropriate values for the symbol that it had just found.
 * The DIP should then continue looking for the next symbol that
 * matches the search criteria (unless it can tell that there
 * won't be anymore). After the search has completed, the routine
 * should return SR_EXACT if any symbols were found and SR_NONE
 * otherwise.
