DESCRIPTION

CMDEDIT (OS2EDIT) is a program that allows editing and retrieval of the
command line, allows commands to be assigned to functions keys, and allows
aliases for commands to be created

COMMAND LINE

        CMDEDIT [options] [aliasfile [cmdfile]] (DOS)
        CMDEDIT -q [cmdfile]                    (DOS)
        OS2EDIT                                 (OS/2)

        Options:

          -i    Go to insert mode at the start of each command.
          -s    Make insert mode 'sticky' between commands. (overrides -i)
          -e    Always save commands at the end of the buffer.
                Normally, duplicate commands are not stored in the buffer.
          -a    Use the aliases regardless of the process requesting the string.
                Normally it tries to determine if COMMAND.COM is the requesting
                process, but the check does not work properly on some systems,
                or if a subsequent command processor has been invoked.
          -f    Stop completing a file name when multiple choices exist. See
                descriptions of Tab and Shift-Tab keys for details.
	  -l	Complete file names in lower case
          -mx   Character x will be used to separate multiple commands
	  -h    Directory commands (u,d,o,r) must be preceded with '#'
	  -\	Append '\' after directories, and ' ' after normal files
	  	during filename completion

        Notes:

        - If the environment variable CMDEDIT (or OS2EDIT) is set, and
          no command is given to CMDEDIT (OS2EDIT) the environment variable
          will be used as the command line.

        - [cmdfile] may be used to save the command buffer if CMDEDIT is
          unloaded then reloaded. For example:

              cmdedit -q cmd.fil
              cmdedit alias.fil cmd.fil

          will use cmd.fil to save/restore the internal command buffer.
          
        Notes for OS/2:

        - OS2EDIT.DLL is also loaded and needs to be in a LIBPATH directory
          (where you keep your other .DLL files)

        - You must remove the SET KEYS=ON statment from CONFIG.SYS.

        - You may not pass the command line directly to OS2EDIT. You must
          use the environment variable method to pass the command line.


The default alias file name is

        none                                (DOS)
        C:\ALIAS.OS2                        (OS/2)


FORM OF THE ALIAS FILE

The alias file contains records of the following form

word  string             - When <word> appears as the first word on the
                           command line, it will be substituted with
                           <string> before being passed to DOS.

<Fn> string              - When <Fn> is hit, CMDEDIT behaves as if <string> were
                           typed by you. It is inserted if you are in insert
                           mode, overstrikes if not, etc..
                           keys F1 thru F40 are supported.

<Fn> !string             - As above, but an <ENTER> is generated
                           following string.

Only keys F1 through F10 on the keyboard are actually used.  For F11 thru
F20, use the shift key, for F21 to F30 use Ctrl key and for F31 to F40 use
the Alt key.

Within the replacement string, the symbols %1 %2 ...  %9 are replaceable by
parameters.  When the alias is invoked, each blank delimited word following
the alias word is considered to be a parameter to the alias.  Parameters
which have no corresponding %n in the alias are appended to the end of the
command.  For example, if

        printps myfile lpt1

is typed, and the alias

        printps copy preamble.ps+%1.c+eoj.ps

is present in the alias list, the resulting DOS command would be

        copy preamble.ps+myfile.c+eoj.ps lpt1

A symbol such as %name% within an alias will be replaced with the corresponding
DOS or OS/2 environment variable name. For example, the alias

        addpath      set path=%path%;%1

will cause another directory to be added to your path when used.

Aliases are substituted recursively. For example, if the aliases

        rn   rename %1 %2
        bk   rn %1.c %1.bak

are present, typing

        bk foo

is equivalent to typing

        rename foo.c foo.bak

Recursive definitions are handled as well. The alias

        dir     dir *.c

is perfectly alright, although somewhat limited in its usefulness.
EDITING FEATURES

Whenever a command is executed, CMDEDIT will save the command in a buffer for
future recall and editing.  When the buffer becomes full, the oldest command is
discarded.  CMDEDIT will not save a second copy of a command that is already
present in the buffer.

Multiple commands

!   (or as set by -m)         Separates multiple commands on a line.
                              A real exclamation point must be entered as !!.

Command Retrieval

Key               Alternate   Meaning

Cursor-Up                     retrieve previous command from the buffer
Cursor-Down                   retrieve next command from the buffer
Ctrl-Cursor-Up    Alt-E       retrieve first command from buffer
Ctrl-Cursor-Down  Alt-B       retrieve last command from buffer
Ctrl-Delete       Alt-X       delete the current command from the buffer
Page-Down                     save the unentered command line in the buffer
Alt-C                         list all commands in the buffer
Alt-L                         list all current aliases
Ctrl-Tab          Alt-N       retrieve next command that begins as ... see below
Alt-Tab           Alt-P       retrieve previous command that begins as ...
Ctrl-Insert       Alt-Z       retrieve accidentally erased line

The Alt-Tab and Ctrl-Tab commands are used by typing the beginning of a command
which is in the buffer then pressing the key.  The entire command will then
appear on the command line.  You can press Alt-Tab again to see other commands
starting with that prefix.

Cursor movement

Cursor-Left                   move left on command line
Cursor-Right                  move right on command line
Home                          move to beginning of line
End                           move to end of line
Ctrl-Cursor-Left              move left word
Ctrl-Cursor-Right             move right word

Line editing

Insert                        toggle in and out of insert mode
Delete                        delete character under cursor
Ctrl-Delete                   delete to end of word
Backspace                     delete character to left of cursor
Ctrl-Backspace                delete to beginning of word
Escape                        delete input line and leave insert mode
Ctrl-Home                     erase to beginning of line
Ctrl-End                      erase to end of line
Alt-H		              toggle the -h option interactively

Retrieving screen items

Alt-Cursor-Up     Alt-U       move a cursor up the screen
Alt-Cursor-Down   Alt-D       move a cursor down the screen
Alt-Cursor-Left   Alt-L       move a cursor left on the screen
Alt-Cursor-Right  Alt-R       move a cursor right on the screen
Alt-Home          Alt-0       move screen cursor to column 0
Alt-End           Alt-2       retrieve two lines from screen

This is useful for changing your path.  Type path, then retrieve it from
the screen, edit it into a command and press Enter.  You can also type a
batch file, then execute certain commands from it using this capability.

File name completion

Tab                           Complete file name
Shift-Tab                  /  List choices if -f option in effect.
                           \  List previous file name if -f not in effect.

These keys are used by typing the first part of a filename and then
pressing Tab.  For example, typing edit my<TAB> will expand to edit
MYFILE.C if the file MYFILE.C is the first file starting with 'MY' in the
current directory.  If Tab is pressed before the first space on the line,
the path is searched for a matching command.  For example, typeing
cmde<TAB> might expand to c:\lang\bin\CMDEDIT.EXE.  Subsequent TABS
will list the next file matching the pattern.  Shift-Tab will back up one
file name.  With -f in effect, the file name is only completed to a point
where a choice must be made, and Shift-Tab will list those choices.  More
characters may then by typed to differentiate between the choices and Tab
hit again.  Also the environment variable CMDMATCH controls which file
extensions are to be matched.  For example, set CMDMATCH=.C.H.ASM means
only match files of type .C, .H and .ASM.  set CMDMATCH=~.OBJ.EXE means
match all files except those of type
.OBJ and .EXE.

DIRECTORY COMMANDS

I hate typing the '\' character.  It's in an awkward spot on the keyboard.
This fact prompted me to put some support into CMDEDIT to change the
current working directory without typing '\'.  I also like to change my
current working directory and drive as an atomic operation.  In the
directory commands, the following substitutions are made in a path.

    /   becomes \
    ' ' becomes \
    -   becomes ..\

For example, "--codegen 8086 c" and "--codegen/8086/c" both become
"..\..\codegen\8086\c".

Commands

        d [d:]path             Set current drive to d and directory to path
        o [d:]path             The "over" command. Equivalent to #d [d:]..\path
        u [n]                  Go up n levels in the tree
        r                      Return to the previous drive and directory

You can alias these commands as well. I have aliases for 'd', 'o', 'u' and
'r' in my alias file.
