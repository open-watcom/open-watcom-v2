Building libraries:
    1) cd to the misc directory of your choice:
    	os2v2		-- OS/2 2.0
	nt		-- Windows NT
	dosos2		-- DOS and OS/2 1.x bound exe's
	dos		-- DOS-only exe's
    2) type wmake
    

Steps for building all the programs at once:

    1) cd to the systems directory of your choice:
    	os2v2		-- OS/2 2.0
	nt		-- Windows NT
	dosos2		-- DOS and OS/2 1.x bound exe's
	dos		-- DOS-only exe's
    2) type wmake
    

Steps for building a particular program

    1) cd to the src directory that contains the program
    2) If you wish to build for a specific target, type
	    wmake targos=<targname>
       where <targname> is one of os2v2, nt, dosos2, or dos.
       If you do not specify the targos, then the makefiles try to
       guess... if you're building under
		OS/2		the default is targos=os2v2
		DOS		the default is targos=dosos2
		NT		the default is targos=nt


Steps for adding a new program:

    1) Make a directory in the src directory that has the same name
	as the program.
    2) Create a makefile in this directory that is similar to the
	makefile for one of the other programs.  The makefile must
	define these two macros:
	
	    name 	-- must be the same as the directory and program name
	    objs	-- space delimited list of object file names
	
	it can also define:
	
	    cflags	-- appended to flags specified automatically
	
	Then the makefile should !include $(posix_dir)\mif\makeone.mif.
    3) Add the program name to mif\commands.mif


Steps for adding a new operating system:

    1) grep for targos in the mif subdirectory, it should be obvious what
	needs to be changed.
    2) create a directory with an appropriate name
    3) copy and modify the makefile from one of the os2v2, dos, dosos2,
	or nt directories.
	


Notes about the programs:

    The programs are either compiled compact model (16-bit) or flat
    model (32-bit).  The current makeall structure doesn't support
    mixed model object files in the same directory...
