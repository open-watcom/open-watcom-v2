WATCOM VIPER DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT		DRAFT
====================================            =====

I. Overview
-----------
    Viper addresses the problem of managing all the files and tools
    that a programmer uses when developing a project.  This includes
    all the source files, include files, libraries, compiler(s), linkers,
    preprocessors etc. that are used.

    Viper has a graphical interface that makes it easy to visualize the
    make up of a project.  A single Viper session shows a *project*.  If
    the project consists of a number of components (such as 2 executables
    and 1 library), these are each shown as a *target* sub-windows on the
    project window.  Each target window shows the files that are needed
    to construct the target and is associated via its filename extension
    with a *rule* that describes the construction mechanism.  For example,
    a filename with the extension .exe may be associated with the rule
    for constructing 16Bit Windows executables, or a filename with the
    extension .lib may be associated with the rule for constructing static
    libraries.  Different projects can refer to the same target.  If they
    do, the target is shared and can be manipulated via either project,
    with changes made through one effecting the other.

    Viper itself is a collection of programs that manage the various
    files and tools that are used to create the target libraries and
    executables.  It creates makefile(s) from the information in the
    target descriptions and invokes WMAKE to construct the targets
    themselves.  Via a configuration file, Viper contains build-in
    knowledge of the WATCOM compilers, editor and program browser and
    all their switches.  The open architecture of the configuration file
    makes it is easy to add new tools and file types.

II. A Quick Tutorial
------------------
    This tutorial will take you through creating and executing a simple
    C program under MS Windows.  It will give you an understanding of the
    basic concepts of Viper and the steps involved in project development.
    
    First, start the Viper environment.  Under MS Windows, this is done
    by double-clicking on the Viper icon in the program manager window.

    1. Defining a Project.

	Define a project by selecting the *File/New project...* menu item.
	When asked for a project name, enter the name *\mydir\test.wpj*
	where mydir is the desired root directory of the project.  The
	project description will be stored in this file, and Viper will make
	it the current-working-directory during your session.  Press *OK*
	and Viper will ask for a target name.  Here, type *test.exe* in the
	first field to specify the name of your target program in the project.
	Next. choose the type of target from a list of target types that 
	Viper knows how to build.  Since you will wish to execute the
	program we are about to write, choose a target type that can run
	on your machine.  If you are running the MSWindows version of Viper,
	choose *16Bit Windows Executable*.  If you are running the OS2/PM
	version, choose *32Bit OS2/PM Executable*.  Then press *OK*.
	You will now see the *target sub-window* for the test.exe target.
	(Note: If the project were to contain more than one target, each
	would have to reside in a different directory!)

    2. Adding a source file.

	Next, add a source file to the list of items that make up test.exe.
	Choose the menu item *Sources/New source...*, and enter the filename
	*test.c*.  (Note: You can do this either by choosing from the menu
	bar or by positioning the mouse over the files list area and
	clicking the right mouse button.  Viper displays a *popup menu* from 
	which you can choose the desired action.)  When you have entered the 
	source file name, press *OK*.  The filename test.c now appears in the
	list of items, followed by the characters (n/a).  This means that 
	the file does not yet exist on the disk.
    
	Next, edit/create the source file by selecting *test.c* (click with
	the left mouse button) and then choosing the menu item 
	*Sources/Edit text*. (Note: Editing can also be invoked by 
	double-clicking on the filename.)  This action invokes the WATCOM 
	Editor to edit the file. Enter the following source for test.c using 
	the editor.
    
	    #include <stdio.h>
    
	    void main()
	    {
		int i;
		for( i=0; i<10; i++ ) {
		    printf( "Value is %d.\n", i )
		}
	    }
	    
	(Note: we have intentionally left off the semi-colon that should
	appear at the end of the printf statement!)
    
	Exit the editor by choosing the menu item *File/Exit*.

	Since Viper does not know that the editor has created the file,
	it still shows it as (n/a).  You can make sure that Viper is in
	tune with the state of all the disk files by choosing the menu
	item *Window/Refresh*.  This updates the source file list for the
	target.

    3. Making the target.

	Since this is the only file in the target, you are now ready to
	compile and link it.  Do this by selecting the *Targets/Make* menu
	item.  Viper will now construct a makefile based on its knowledge of
	the target and construction rules, and then invoke the WMAKE utility
	to create test.exe.  The output of this procedure is displayed in the
	Viper Log window.  Since we made an intentional error in the source
	file, errors are encountered during the make and the error message(s) 
	are shown in the log window.  You can edit the offending source file
	by selecting the error message (left mouse button) and then selecting
	the *Log/Edit log* menu item. (Note: Editing can also be invoked by
	double-clicking on the error message.) An explanation of the error
	can be displayed by choosing the *Log/Help log* menu item.  Correct
	the error using the editor, exit as before, and choose *Targets/Make*
	again.  Repeat this procedure until you have an error-free compile
	and link and the program test.exe has been created.

    4. Executing the target program.
    
	You are now ready to execute the program you have developed.  Do this
	by choosing the *Targets/Run* menu item.  Viper will execute the 
	program test.exe.

	The program you have written uses the default-Windows support built
	in to the WATCOM C library.  As such, the output of your program is
	shown in a window.  To close this window, select the menu item
	*File/Exit*.

    5. Debugging the target program.

	Since this is a simple program, you probably have no need to debug it
	using the WATCOM Debugger.  However, lets go though the steps so that
	you will know what to do on your own, more complex programs.
    
	To debug a program, first it must be compiled to include debugging
	information.  Viper maintains two sets of switches for each target
	in a project.  These are known as the *Development Switches* and the
	*Release Switches*.  Each target can be placed in development or
	release mode using the menu items *Targets/Setup target/Use
	Development Switches* or *Targets/Setup target/Use Release Switches*.

	By default, Viper has placed your target in development mode and
	debugging information to be included by the compilers and linkers.
	To invoke the debugger, choose the *Targets/Debug* menu item.  Viper
	will invoke the debugger.  Step through the code using the 
	*Run/Trace over* menu item until the message *Task completed* is
	encountered.  Then choose *File/Exit* to terminate the debugging
	session.

	To override any of the switches for the source compilers or target
	linkers, select the appropriate target and/or source file and choose
	the menu item *Sources/Setup source/Switches* or *Targets/Setup
	target/Switches* respectively. A dialog window is displayed that
	shows all the switches available for the compiler or linker.
	Press the *>>* button until you are at the desired screen and set
	the switches the way you want them.  Page around the screens making
	changes and when you are done, press *OK*.

    6. Saving the project and terminating the session.

        You can now exit the Viper session by choosing the menu item
	*File/Exit*.  If you have not already saved your project, you will
	be prompted to do so.  Choose *Yes*, and the session will end.

    7. Review of what happened.

 	In this tutorial, you created a project called test.wpj, which
	was composed of one target called test.exe.  The target was a
	16Bit Windows executable.  You used the WATCOM Editor to enter
	and edit the source text in a file called test.c and then compiled
	and linked it into an executable program using the WMAKE utility,
	the WATCOM C Compiler and the WATCOM Linker.  You executed it both
	directly and under the control of the WATCOM Debugger.

	When you saved the project, Viper created the following permanent
	files.  Test.wpj describes the screen layout and refers to a file
	called test.tgt.  Test.tgt describes the target executable test.exe
	and all switches required to link it.  It also describes test.c,
	and switches required to compile it.

	When you pressed the *Make* button, Viper created a number of
	temporary makefiles (called *.mk and *.mak).

III. Reference
-------------
    1. Methodology.
    
        Viper deals with an entity called a 'project', which consists of
	a number of 'targets'.  A project is represented on disk by a
	project descriptor file having the file extension of 'wpj', while
	a target is represented on disk by a target descriptor file having
	the file extension of 'tgt'.  Each target descriptor file must
	reside in a different disk directory.  This directory is considered
	the target directory, and all compiler and linker executions for
	that target take place there.

	    (Note: You *cannot* safely edit either the .wpj or
	    the .tgt files with a text editor!)

	The project descriptor file (.wpj) describes a project.  It contains
	the names of all the target descriptor files that make up the project
	plus certain housekeeping information about the Viper session.

	Each target descriptor file (.tgt) describes a target within a
	project.  It contains the name and type of the target program,
	a reference to a *Rule* defined in the Viper configuration file
	(viper.cfg) describing how to build it, and a list of relevant
	switches used by the rule.  In addition, it contains the names of
	all the files used to construct the target program, references
	to similar rules for compiling them, and relevant switches.  Other
	housekeeping data is also kept in the target descriptor file.

	In constructing targets, Viper references a list of *Rules* that
	are defined in a configuration file called viper.cfg.  Among other
	things, each rule defines a command line used to do the construction,
	and a list of actions that can be performed on the target program
	(e.g., make, run, debug) or on the files in the item list (e.g.,
	make, edit).  Additionally, rules refer to *Tools* that define
	the command line switches settable by the programmer using the
	Viper environment.

	Once a project and one or more targets is defined, Viper can create
	a makefile and invoke the WMAKE utility to construct the target
	program.  These steps are described in the following paragraphs.

	When the Make action is selected, Viper first constructs a set of
	makefiles usable by the WATCOM WMAKE utility program.  The root
	makefile is created in the project directory and other target
	makefiles are created in each of the target directories.  Then
	Viper executes WMAKE in a batch program environment associated
	with the current platform.

	Under MS Windows, Viper starts a DOS program dosserv.exe 
	(via batchbox.pif). It uses these to run the WMAKE utility and 
	capture its output into the log window.  Under MS Windows, DOS 
	versions of WMAKE and all the compilers etc, are used.
	(Make sure the setup has been done as described in appendix C.)

	Under OS2/PM, Viper follows a similar strategy.  It uses the
	batserv.exe utility (which must be running) to execute the
	WMAKE utility and capture its output into the log window.  Under
	OS2/PM, OS2 versions of WMAKE and all the compilers etc, are used.
	(Make sure the setup has been done as described in appendix C.)
	
    2. Viper Development Environment (viper.exe):

        The main program in the Viper suite of programs is viper.exe.
	It is used to define the .wpj and .tgt files, create makefiles,
	invoke WMAKE and other tools, invoke the editor and browser when
	requested, and otherwise apply the tools described in the Viper
	configuration file (viper.cfg).

        a) Command line switches.

	    viper.exe is invoked using the following command line:

		viper [switches] [filename.wpj]

	    where:

	        [switches] is zero or more of the following:
    
			+c filename	- this defines an alternate file to
				          be used in place of viper.cfg.
			-b		- this disables the batch feature
					  and is not very useful.
			+d		- this is a debugging switch and
					  periodically displays debugging
					  information during the execution
					  of viper.exe.
		[filename.wpj] is an optional project descriptor file.

	b) Screen layout.

	    The main screen for viper.exe describes one project, with the
	    project name displayed in the title bar of the main window.
	    It can contain a number of sub-windows which resemble the
	    Windows MDI interface and can be iconisized, cascaded, tiled,
	    etc., using the close box and the *Window* menu items.
    
	    Each sub-window in the main screen represents a target in the
	    project, with the name of the target program or library shown
	    in the title bar, relative to the project file directory.  There
	    can be only one target per directory.
    
	    Each target sub-window contains a list of source files that
	    are required to construct the target program.  These names are
	    relative to the target directory.
    
	    The menu lists called *Targets* and *Sources* operate on the
	    current target sub-window.  They can be invoked from the menu
	    bar or activated with the right mouse button. Some of the menu
	    items in these lists are present for all targets and sources, and
	    some exist only for certain file types.  These optional menu
	    items are called *Actions* and are defined as part of the rules
	    associated with the target and its source files.
    
	    The target sub-window can also contain buttons that represent
	    certain additional actions that can be performed on the target.
	    They are also called *Actions* and are defined using the
	    *Button* option as part of the rule associated with the target.
	    
	    The Viper Log windows also appears as a sub-window. It captures
	    and displays output lines from the various tools described in
	    the viper.cfg file.
    
	c) Menu Bar and Menu items.

	    The Viper menu bar and menu items are listed here for reference.

    4) Batch Viper (viperb.exe):

        A supplementary program in the Viper suite of programs is bviper.exe.
	It is run from the DOS command line and takes as input an existing
	.wpj file or a list of existing	target descriptor (.tgt) files, and
	creates the same makefiles that	viper.exe creates when *Make* is
	selected.  It uses the same Viper configuration file (viper.cfg)
	that is used by viper.exe.

	Using viperb.exe, you can create makefiles from .tgt files in
	batch mode, and then invoke WMAKE to process them.  This is handy
	if you want to develop applications using the Viper Development
	Environment, but have a need to build the target programs in some
	sort of automated, batch mode manner.

	a) Command line switches:

	    bviper.exe is invoked using the following command line:

		bviper [*options] [*filename.tgt]

	    where:

	        [options] is zero or more of the following:

		-p wpjfile	- loads wpjfile.wpj (project.wpj by default).
		-c cfgfile	- loads cfgfile instead of viper.cfg.
		-d		- generate makefiles using development switch set.
		-r		- generate makefiles using release switch set.
    
		[filename.tgt] is one or more target descriptor files to
				be used to create the makefiles.
	b) Example:

	    For example, to make the target program developed in the first
	    tutorial above, use the following command lines.

	    viperb -p \mydir\test.wpj
	    wmake -f test.mk


Appendix A: Viper and Batch Viper configuration file (viper.cfg)
----------------------------------------------------------------

    This appendix describes the syntax of the commands used in the
    Viper configuration file (viper.cfg).  The example listing included
    is representative of those found in the actual viper.cfg file included
    in the distribution.

    There are 4 basic statements in the file:

    	Tool
	Rule
	Project
	MsgLog

    First in the file are a number of *Tool* statements that define
    compilers, linkers, etc., and their associated sets of switches.
    These are used in subsequent *Rule* statements and must be defined
    *before* any rule that references them.

    Next in the file are a number of *Rule* statements that describe how
    files with various file extensions are to be processed by the previously
    defined tools.
    
    Next, there is one *Project* statement that defines certain
    parameters associated with the Viper session.
    
    Finally, there is one *MsgLog* statement that defines the patterns
    needed to process the Viper Log window.

    When describing the statements below, the following conventions are
    used.  If a line begins with an asterisk (*), it can appear zero or
    more times in the file.  If a symbol begins with a capital letter, it
    is a keyword and must appear as shown.  If a symbol begins with a
    lower-case letter, it should be substituted with a character string
    according to the associated description.  Such character strings must
    be enclosed in quotation marks if they contain spaces or commas.

    1) Tool statement------------------------------------------------------------------------

    *Tool tooltag toolname

    Tool	- defines a tool
    tooltag	- a tag name for the tool
    toolname	- a longer name for the tool

    IncludeTool	- names a tool to include as part of this tool
    tooltag	- name of the included tool

    Family	- defines a family of switches for the tool
    famname	- the name for the family of switches; each family appears
    		  as a separate screen in the *Setup* dialogs under Viper.

    CSwitch	- defines a checkbox switch that can be on or off
    0|1		- controls whether the switch should be displayed on the
    		  left or right side if the screen in the *Setup* dialog.
		  all 0 switches must preceed all 1 switches in a family.
    mask	- this is a string of letters and/or question-marks (?)
    		  that are used to select the switch for use in a specific
		  context.  It is explained under description of the
		  *Project/Target* statement below.
    swname	- a description of the switch.  It must be short enough to
    		  fit on 1/2 of the *Setup* dialog.  If it is omitted, the
		  switch cannot be reset by the user.  An omitted swname
		  is used in conjunction with the mask field to specify
		  system-dependent switches.
    switch	- the actual switch value to be included on the generated
    		  command line.
    ON|OFF	- sets the initial state of the switch.

    RGroup	- defines the name given to the subsequent group of radio switches
    RSwitch	- defines a radio switch that can be on or off

    VSwitch	- defines a switch that can be associated with a character
    		  string.
    value	- the default value to be supplied to the VSwitch
    ONE|MULTI	- specifies that the associated VSwitch can appear more
    		  than once on the command line.
    ON|OFF	- sets the initial state of the switch.  When used with a
    		  VSwitch, it also implies that the switch can appear on
		  the command line without an associated character string
		  value.

    2) Rule statement-------------------------------------------------------

    *Rule ruletag, rulename [,tooltag [,mask]]
	*[Source wildsrc*]
	*[Target wildtgt*]
	[Autodepend]
	[BrowseSwitch switch]
	*Symbol symtag, wildsym
	*Command commandtext [,mask]
	*Action actionname [,tooltag]
	    Command commandtext
	    [Hint hinttext]
	    [Default]
	    [Button]

    Rule	- defines a rule
    ruletag	- a tag name for the rule
    rulename	- a longer name for the rule
    tooltag	- the tooltag of a tool that will be used to generate
    		  the switches in the subsequent *Command* definitions.
    mask	- this is a string of letters and/or question-marks (?)
    		  that are used to select the rule for use in a specific
		  context.  It is explained under description of the
		  *Project/Target* statement below.

    Source	- defines files used as input to this rule
    wildsrc	- a wildcard filename (of the form *.yyy), where *yyy*
    		  is the extension of the file that can be transformed
		  into one with extenstion *xxx* (see above) by executing
		  the commands defined in this rule.

    Target	- defines files produced by thos rule
    wildtgt	- a wildcard filename (of the form *.xxx), where *xxx*
    		  is the extension of the file created by executing the
		  commands defined in this rule.

    Autodepend	- says that this rule creates files that support the
    		  .autodepend feature of the WATCOM WMAKE utility

    Browseswitch- says that this rule creates files that support the
    		  WATCOM Program Browser.
    switch	- specified the switch whose presence will cause Viper
    		  to generate control files for the WATCOM Program Browser.

    Symbol	- defines a symbol that Viper will define as a set of
    		  file names for use in the subsequent *Command* definitions.
    symtag	- the name for the symbol
    wildsym	- a wildcard filename (of the form *.zzz), where *zzz*
    		  is the extension of the files that are to be associated
		  with the symbol

    Command	- defines a command line to be part of this rule in the
    		  makefile generated by Viper.
    commandtext	- the actual text to be placed in the makefile rule.  If
    		  the text contains the following character sequences, they
		  are expanded as follows:
		  $@		- full filename
		  $*		- full filename with no extension
		  $&		- filename with no path or extension
		  $.		- filename with no path
		  $:		- only the path of the full filename
		  $$		- a $ character
		  $(%name)	- the value of an environment variable 'name'
		  $<%name>	- the value of an environment variable 'name'
		  $<#tooltag>	- a string of switches from the named tool
		  		  that match the *maskdef* of the chosen
				  target type. (see *Project/Target)
		  $<mask>	- a string of switches that match *mask*
		  $<symtag[!][=][,][;][+]>
		  		- a list of filenames associated with
				  *symtag* as defined in a previous *Symbol*
				  statement.  If (!) is specified, the name
				  of the symbol is not included in the
				  expansion.  If (=) is included, the name
				  of the symbol (if included) is followed by
				  an equal sign.  If either (,) or (;) or (+)
				  are included, the filenames in the list
				  are separated by that character, otherwise
				  they are separated by blanks.

    Action	- defines an action associated with the rule
    actionname	- the name of the action.  This becomes the name used in
    		  any menu item or button generated by Viper.
    tooltag	- the tooltag of a tool that will be used to generate
    		  the switches in the subsequent *Command* definition.

    Command	- a command to be executed if this action is chosen.
    commandtext	- the actual text to be executed. If the text contains
    		  any of the characters shown for the *Rule/Command*
		  definition, they are treated in the way described there.
		  If the text begins with the sequence !Editor, it is passed
		  via DDE to the WATCOM Editor. If it begins with !Batch,
		  it is passed via DDE to the Viper Message Log program to
		  be run as a batch program. If it begins with !Browse, it
		  is passed via DDE to the WATCOM Program Browser.  If it
		  begins with !Make, Viper first creates a makefile and then
		  treats the command as if it began with !Batch.

    Hint	- specified hint text associated with the action.
    hinttext	- the actual text displayed as hint text by Viper when
    		  this action is highlighted.  Only shown if *Button* is
		  not specified.

    Default	- says that this action is the default action in the group.
    		  It will be invoked if the user double-clicks on a file
		  item that is associated with this rule.

    Button	- says that this action should be shown as a button rather
    		  than as a menu item.

    3) Project statement---------------------------------------------------

    Project
	*Action ...
	*Target wildtyp, maskdef, targname
	Editor editorname
	Browse browsename
	Batch batchname [batchname2]
	Makefile (must match WMAKE rule!)

    Project	- defines the start of the project section in viper.cfg

    Action	- defines an action as described under the *Rule* statement.
    		  These actions will appear under the *Actions* menu in
		  the Viper session.

    Target	- defines a target that Viper knows how to make.
    wildtyp	- a wildcard filename (of the form *.xxx), where *xxx*
    		  is the extension of a target file.  When a
		  target file is defined during a Viper session, the user
		  selects the type of that target from a list of *Target*
		  types whose *wildtyp* matches the filename of the target
		  specified.
    maskdef	- this is a string of characters (*not* including question
		  marks (?)) that is associated with a target type.  As
		  distributed, viper.cfg uses three characters in the
		  string, where the first represents an operating system
		  platform, the second represents a hardware platform, and
		  the third represents a module type.  The distributed
		  *Tool* and *Rule* masks are set up to reflect this choice.
		  When a user defines a target file, it becomes associated
		  with one of these *Target*s, and therefore has a specific
		  target *maskdef*.  Whenever Viper generates chooses a
		  *Rule*, generates a *Command* line, or processes *Tool*
		  switches, it restricts its choices to those that match
		  the target file *maskdef*.  If a mask character is (?),
		  the corresponding character in the maskdef is said to
		  match; if not, the two characters must match exactly.

    Editor	- specifies a default text editor for the Viper session.
    editorname	- the name of the session text editor.  If the name begins
    		  with the character (!), Viper assumes it is an editor
		  that conforms to the WATCOM Editor DDE conventions and
		  treats it as such.

    Browse	- specifies a default program browser for the Viper session.
    browsename	- the name of the session program bropwser.  If the name
    		  begins with the character (!), Viper assumes it is a
		  browser that conforms to the WATCOM Program Browser DDE
		  conventions and treats it as such.

    Batch	- specifies the name of the Message Log program that Viper
    		  is to use to execute batch makes and other actions.
    batchname	- the actual name of the Viper Log Program that is used
    		  under MS Windows, this should be msglog.exe.
    batchname2	- the actual name of the Viper Log Program that is used
    		  under Win/OS2, this should be msglog2.exe.

    4) MsgLog statement---------------------------------------------------

    MsgLog
        *Help ext, helpfile
	*Scan pattern

    MsgLog	- defines the start of the message log section of viper.cfg.

    Help	- defines a help file and associates it with a particular
    		  file extension.
    ext		- a file extension of the form .c or .cpp 
    		  (include the period)
    helpfile	- the name of a help file

    Scan	- defines a scan pattern used by the message log processor
    		  to parse filenames, error codes, line and column numbers
		  from the output of the compilers and linkers, etc.
    pattern	- <pattern1> [<pattern2>]
    		  When required, Viper scans each successive pattern 
		  statement looking for a pattern that matches the currently
		  selected line in the Viper log window.  A match results in 
		  the extraction of a *filename* and possible a *linenumber*,
		  *offsetnumber*, and/or *errornumber*. These are then used 
		  to invoke the session editor or help manager respectively.
	
		  A match is found if *pattern1* matches the current line and
		  *pattern2*, if present, matches a previous line, giving a 
		  *filename*. The syntax of a pattern is a simple character
		  string that includes %f to extract a filename, %l to 
		  extract a line number, %o to extract an offset number, %h 
		  to extract an error number, and %* to match any number of 
		  characters.  Patterns must begin and end with the angle
		  brackets (<>).
