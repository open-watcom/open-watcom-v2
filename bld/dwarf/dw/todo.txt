Here are some things that were not completed:

- the library doesn't check if it is being asked to generate info for the
    browser or debugger.  Basically the only thing that this should be
    checked for is the .debug_aranges and .debug_pubnames sections.

- Anthony's example:
        struct B {
            int x, y;
        }
        struct D : private B {
            B::y;
        }
    still has no mapping... this depends on how the DWARF guys decide
    we should map it.

- I didn't test labels in location expressions.

- The examples in the docs are just plain wrong... the only real examples
    available are those in testtest.c.
