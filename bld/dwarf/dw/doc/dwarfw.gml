.section Data Types
.*
.np
The following types are defined in "dwcnf.h" and may be redefined
if the entire library is to be recompiled ("dw.h" automatically
includes "dwcnf.h").
.begnote
.notehd1 Type
.notehd2 Description
.note dw_sym_handle
Has a client defined meaning; the DW library will pass these
back to the client in
.id CLIRelocs
for
.id DW_W_STATIC
, and
.id DW_W_SEGMENT
.period
.note dw_targ_addr
The contents of
.id dw_targ_addr
is unimportant to the DW library; it is only used for
.id sizeof( dw_targ_addr )
.period
A
.id dw_targ_addr
is the type that will be emitted for relocations to run-time addresses.
.note dw_targ_seg
This is the size of the quantity that
.id DW_W_SEGMENT
emits.
.note dw_addr_offset
The type used for offsets from some base address.
For example, the
.id start_scope
parameter to typing routines, or the
.id addr
parameter to line number information.
The code assumes this is an unsigned integer type.
.note dw_addr_delta
An integer type that can hold the largest possible
difference between the
.id addr
parameter for two subsequent calls to
.id DWLineNum
.period
.note dw_linenum
A line number.
It must be an unsigned integer type.
.note dw_linenum_delta
dw_linenum_delta is a type that can hold the largest possible
difference between two adjacent line
numbers passed to
.id DWLineNum
or
.id DWReference
.period
.note dw_column
A column number.
It must be an unsigned integer type.
.note dw_column_delta
Type that can hold the largest possible difference between two
adjacent column numbers passed to
.id DWReference
.period
.note dw_size_t
Used for sizes of various things such as block constants
(i.e. for DWAddEnumerationConstant) and the
.id size
parameter to
.id CLIWrite
.period
.note dw_uconst
An unsigned integer type that can hold the largest possible
unsigned integer constant.
.note dw_sconst
A signed integer type that can hold the largest possible
signed integer constant.
.note dw_sectnum
Enumerated type that can hold all defined Dwarf sections,
passed to client functions
.note dw_out_offset
A integer type that can hold the largest possible section offset
passed to
.id CLISeek
and returned by
.id CLITell
.note dw_reloc_type
A integer type that can hold the all relocation type
.endnote

.section Initialization and Finalization
.*
.np
In the following functions, unless specified otherwise all strings
are assumed to be null-terminated.
.np
The DW library does not assume that a pointer passed to it is valid
beyond the function call used to pass it.
For example, you can pass the address of an auto-buffer that contains a
string.
.np
All names passed to the DW library should be unmangled.
.np
The
.id cli
parameter required for all DW functions except
.id DWInit
is assumed to be a valid value returned by a call to
.id DWInit
.period
.np
Currently DWENTRY is defined to be nothing.
It was created in case there is ever a need to put the DW library into
a DLL.
.beglevel
.*
.section DWInit
.*
.dwfunc dw_client DWENTRY DWInit( dw_init_info *info )
.np
Initialization for a compilation unit.
Return an unique client id.
This function will call client functions passed to it, so any client function
initialization must be done before the call to DWInit.
.millust begin
typedef struct {
    void          (*reloc)( dw_sectnum, uint, ... );

.notehd1 Bit
.notehd2 Description
.note DW_CM_BROWSER
The library generates the debugging information for the class
browser.
.note DW_CM_DEBUGGER
The library generates the debugging information for the debugger.
.note DW_CM_UPPER
For FORTRAN - The compiler converts all identifier names to upper
case.
.note DW_CM_LOWER
For FORTRAN - The compiler converts all identifier names to lower
case.
.endnote
.note producer
A string that identifies the compiler.
.note exception_handler
If the library ends up in a situation which it can't handle (can we say bug ;-)
) this jmp_buf will be called with a non-zero value.
This is a fatal exit, and the client should not call any of the DW functions.
.np
FIXME: The library is currently not very good at cleaning up memory in these situations.
.note funcs
These functions are described in a later section.
The initialization routines may call any of them; so any initialization
necessary for these routines must be done before DWInit is called.
.endnote
.np
The details of the above functions are discussed in Part 3.
.*
.section DWFini
.*
.dwfunc void DWENTRY DWFini( dw_client cli )
.np
Finalize the debugging information generator.
This routine must be called last.
It frees any structures that the DW library required, and flushes all the
debugging information.
.*
.section DWBeginCompileUnit
.*
.dwfunc dw_handle DWENTRY DWBeginCompileUnit( dw_client cli, const char *source_filename, const char *directory, dw_loc_handle segment, const unsigned offset_size )
.np
This function is called some time after
.id DWInit
.period
The only other DW functions that can be called in between are those
dealing with location expressions.
.begnote
.notehdr Parameter
.note source_filename
Name of the source file.
.note directory
Compilation directory.
.note segment
A location expression who's result is the code segment portion
of the low_pc and high_pc.

.note DW_W_SECTION_POS
.note DW_W_UNIT_SIZE
.endnote
.*
.section DWEndCompileUnit
.*
.dwfunc void DWENTRY DWEndCompileUnit( dw_client cli )
.np
This function pairs up with
.id DWBeginCompileUnit
.period
After this, until the next
.id DWBeginCompileUnit
, the only valid calls are those made to location expression routines
(or
.id DWFini
).
.*
.endlevel
.*
.chap Ordering Considerations
.*
.np
In general the DW routines are called in an order that matches the
order of the declarations during the source program.
The sole exception to this are the Macro information routines.
Since it is possible to have a separate preprocessor pass, the library assumes
that these routines can be called before any of the other routines.
That is why the macro routines have a separate mechanism for specifying file
and line number.
.*
.chap Macro Information
.*
.beglevel
.*
.section DWMacStartFile
.*
.dwfunc void DWENTRY DWMacStartFile( dw_client cli, dw_linenum line, const char *name )
.np
Subsequent DWMac calls refer to the named file.
.*
.section DWMacEndFile
.*
.dwfunc void DWENTRY DWMacEndFile( dw_client cli )
.np
End the current included file.
.*
.section DWMacDef
.*
.dwfunc dw_macro DWENTRY DWMacDef( dw_client cli, dw_linenum line, const char *name )
.np
Defines a macro.
.id name
is the name of the macro.
A
.id dw_macro
is returned and must be used in a subsequent call
to
.id DWMacFini
(and possibly
.id DWMacParam
).
.*
.section DWMacParam
.*
.dwfunc void DWENTRY DWMacParam( dw_client cli, dw_macro mac, const char *name )
.np
Adds a parameter to the macro definition
.id mac
.period
.id name
is the name of the parameter with no leading or trailing white-space.
The order of parameters must be the same as they appear in the source
program.
.*
.section DWMacFini
.*
.dwfunc void DWENTRY DWMacFini( dw_client cli, dw_macro mac, const char *def )
.np
Finishes the macro definition
.id mac
.period
.id def
is the definition string.
.*
.section DWMacUnDef
.*
.dwfunc void DWENTRY DWMacUnDef( dw_client cli, dw_linenum line, const char *name )
.np
Undefines the macro named
.id name
.period
.*
.section DWMacUse

.dwfunc void DWENTRY DWMacUse( dw_client cli, dw_linenum line, const char *name )
.np
Indicate where the macro named
.id name
is used.
.*
.endlevel
.*
.chap File and Line-Number Management
.*
.beglevel
.*
.section DWSetFile
.*
.dwfunc void DWENTRY DWSetFile( dw_client cli, const char *file )
.np
Specifies the current file.
The default is for the source_filename parameter from the dw_init_info
to be the current file.
.*
.section DWLineNum
.*
.dwfunc void DWLineNum( dw_client cli, uint info, dw_linenum line, uint col, dw_addr_offset addr )
.np
Sets the current source line number and machine address.
The line numbers information of all instructions, not just
declarations, are stored by this routine.
Note that all source line numbers are relative to the beginning of
their corresponding source file.
So the line number of the first line of an included file is one.
.begnote
.notehdr Parameter
.note info
The information about the line, which is established by the
combination of the following bits:
.begnote $setptnt 20
.notehd1 Bit
.notehd2 Description
.note DW_LN_DEFAULT
There is no special information about the line.
.note DW_LN_STMT
The line is the beginning of a statement.
.note DW_LN_BLK
The line is the beginning of a block.
.endnote
.note line
Source line number, numbered beginning with one on the first line
of the file.
.note col
Source column number, which begins at 1.
.note addr
Address of instruction relative to the beginning of the compilation unit.
If it is at all possible the client should call
.id DWLineNum
with increasing addrs.
The line parameter does not have to be increasing.
The size of the emitted line number information is smaller if increasing
addrs are used (There is also an implementation limitation that the maximum
decrease of addr between two calls is 32768).
.endnote
.*
.section DWDeclFile
.*
.dwfunc void DWENTRY DWDeclFile( dw_client cli, const char *name )
.np
Subsequent declarations are from the file named
.id name
.period
.*
.section DWDeclPos
.*
.dwfunc void DWENTRY DWDeclPos( dw_client cli, dw_linenum line, dw_column column )
.np
The next declaration occurs at the indicated line and column in the
source file set by the last call to
.id DWDeclFile
.period
Note that the position is only used for the immediate next declaration.
If there are multiple declarations on the same line, then multiple calls
should be made.
.*
.section DWReference
.*
.dwfunc void DWENTRY DWReference( dw_client cli, dw_linenum line, dw_column column, dw_handle dependant )
.np
Indicate that in the source code there is a reference to the dependant.
This reference is attributed to the current scope of debugging information.
(i.e., if it is done inside a structure, then the structure is considered
to be the "referencer").
.*
.endlevel
.*
.chap Location Expression Routines
.*
.np
Many functions require a
.id dw_loc_handle
.period
These are handles for expressions that the debugger will evaluate.
A
.id dw_loc_handle
can be either a single expression, or a list
of expressions created by
.id DWListFini
.period
The BROWSER is only interested in whether a location expression is present or
not; so when creating BROWSER output the client may create an empty location
expression and use that wherever appropriate.
.np
The expressions are evaluated on a stack machine, with operations
described later.
In some cases the stack will be initially empty, in other cases (such
as when calculating the address of a structure field) some base address
will be on the stack.
.np
A location expression is limited to roughly 64K.
Since each op-code is a single byte, this shouldn't pose much of a limitation
(famous last words).
The destination of the branch instructions
.id DW_LOC_BRA
and
.id DW_LOC_SKIP
must be within 32K of the current instruction (This is a limitation of
the DWARF format, not a limitation of the DW library).
.*
.beglevel
.*
.section DWLocInit
.*
.dwfunc dw_loc_id DWENTRY DWLocInit( dw_client cli )
.np
First function called to create a location expression for a symbol.

.*
.section DWLocNewLabel
.*
.dwfunc dw_loc_label DWENTRY DWLocNewLabel( dw_client cli, dw_loc_id loc )
.np
Create a label for the location expression being built in
.id loc
.period
This label can be used for forward or backward references by
.id DW_LOC_SKIP
and
.id DW_LOC_BRA
.period
.*
.section DWLocSetLabel
.*
.dwfunc void DWENTRY DWLocSetLabel( dw_client cli, dw_loc_id loc, dw_loc_label label )
.np
Give the label
.id label
the address of the next operation emitted into the location expression
.id loc
.period
.*
.section DWLocReg
.*
.dwfunc void DWENTRY DWLocReg( dw_client cli, dw_loc_id loc, uint reg )
.np
This 'operation' informs the debugger that the value it seeks is in
the register named by
.id reg
.period
.np
FIXME: need to define the possible values of
.id reg
.period
.*
.section DWLocStatic
.*
.dwfunc void DWENTRY DWLocStatic( dw_client cli, dw_loc_id loc, dw_sym_handle sym )
.np

.note DW_LOC_AND
It pops the top two stack values, performs the logical AND
operation on the two, and pushes the result.
.note DW_LOC_DEREF
It pops the top stack entry and treats it as an address.
The value retrieved from that address is pushed.
The size of data retrieved from the dereferenced address is an

This address is relative to the base address of the compilation unit
referencing this location list.
It marks the beginning of the range over which the location is valid.
.note end
A ending address.
This address is relative to the base address of the compilation unit
referencing this location list.
It marks the first address past the end of the range over which the
location is valid.
Overlapping ranges are possible and are interpreted to mean that the

.chap Typing Information
.*
.np
Unless otherwise noted, calls to these functions emit debugging
information immediately.
The DWARF format requires that debugging information appear in the same order
as it does in the source code.
So, for example, a structure's fields must be created in the same order that
they appear in the source program.
.np
Some of the following functions have common parameters.
Here is the documentation for these common parameters:
.begnote
.notehdr Parameter
.note char *name
A null-terminated type name.
i.e., "struct foobar {}" has the name foobar.
If this parm is NULL then no name is emitted.
.note dw_addr_offset start_scope
This is the offset from the low_pc value for the enclosing block that
the declaration occurs at.
This is most commonly 0.
.note uint flags
Some routines have additional flags available here; but unless otherwise noted,
the following are always available:
.begnote
.notehd1 Flag
.notehd2 Description
.note DW_DECLARATION
The object is a declaration, not a definition
.note DW_FLAG_PRIVATE

.note DW_FT_UNSIGNED_CHAR
.endnote
.np
For convenience, DW_FT_MIN, and DW_FT_MAX are defined.
A valid fundamental type is in the range DW_FT_MIN <= ft < DW_FT_MAX.
The DW library will always return the same handle when called with the same
fundamental type (so the client does not need to save fundamental type
handles).

.note string_length
If this parameter is non-NULL then it is a location expression that
the debugger executes to get the address where the length of the string
is stored in the program.
In this case the

calculated.
If
.id byte_size

.section Performance Considerations
.*
.np
The DW library does it's best to try and group CLIWrite operations together
into one larger CLIWrite, and to try and avoid using CLISeek.
But the library does not go out of it's way to provide this massaging of output.
The client should attempt to buffer the data itself.
CLISeek is most often called on the DW_DEBUG_INFO, and the DW_DEBUG_LOC sections.
The other sections may have one CLISeek performed at the DWFini stage, and
the seek will be to the zero offset.
The client might wish to optimize performance for only the DW_DEBUG_INFO and
the DW_DEBUG_LOC sections.
