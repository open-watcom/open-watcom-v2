BUILDER is a sort of quick and dirty command line processor that is optimized
for the tasks performed when creating an executable image as part of the
build process.


        Searching for the default control file
        --------------------------------------

If no -c command line options are specified, BUILDER looks for an environment
variable called "BUILDER.CTL". The value of that environment variable is
used as name of the default control file. If the variable is not defined, the
file called "BUILDER.CTL" is used. It first checks the current directory, if
the file is not present it will check the parent directories, up to the root
of the current drive. If BUILDER.CTL has not yet been found, the PATH
environment variable is checked. This means that you can put the BUILDER.CTL
in the root directory of a project, and a "BUILDER" command will find it
no matter what project directory you're located in.


        Macro Substitution
        ------------------

Each line of the control file is read in and examined for substrings of the
form "<"var_name">", where var_name is the name of an enviroment variable.
The string is then replaced with the value of the environment variable.
The subsitutions can be nested so that:

        SET FOOBAR=hi there
        SET HA=BAR

        <FOO<HA>>

would be "hi there". A "^" character will escape the character following
so it has no special meaning.

There are two special macro names:

        <CWD>   will be replaced with the current working directory.
        <*>     will be replaced with a space separated list of all the
                command line parameters.


        BUILDER Directives
        ------------------

After the command line is macro-substituted, the first non-blank character
is examined. If it's a "#" character, the line is a comment and is ignored.
If the line starts with "[", it's a BUILDER directive line, otherwise, it's
a system command to be executed. Here are the directives.

        [INCLUDE file_name]

This causes the named file to opened and it's contents processed as a nested
control file.

        [LOG file_name {backup_copies} ]

This causes the named file to be opened and used as the output log file
_if_ there is not already a log file open. Before opening the log file
(or not, if there is already one open), a backup copy of the current contents
of the log file are made. This is done by taking the 3d character of the
log file name extension and changing it to a "1". E.g., a log file of the
name "FOO.BAR" would be backed up to a file named "FOO.BA1". Backup copies
of the backup copies can be made as well. The digit in the extension
increments for each version ("FOO.BA1" => "FOO.BA2"). The number of backup
copies kept is determined by the optional backup_copies value in the LOG
directive. If backup_copies is not specified in the LOG directive, the value
of the -b command line option is used. If no -b is specified, the default
number of backup copies is one.

        [BLOCK match word1 word2 word3...]

The "match" word is compared in turn with the words following. If it matches
one of the words following, the commands following are executed. If none
of the words match, the commands are skipped, until the next BLOCK directive
or until the end of the control file. If you want to start unconditional
execution of commands after you've had a sequence of BLOCK's, just use a
BLOCK that's sure to match, e.g.:

        [BLOCK . .]


        Built-in Commands
        -----------------

If a line is not a comment, or a directive, it is handed off to be executed
(assuming you're not in a BLOCK section that's being skipped). Normally
it's given to the system to be executed, but there are a number of
commands that are "built-in" and executed directly by BUILDER. These are:

        CD new_dir

Change the current working directory to "new_dir". Note that unlike the
DOS command processor, if a drive letter is included in the new_dir string,
the current drive is changed as well.

        CDSAY new_dir

Same as above, but the resulting directory name is written to the screen and
to any log file(s).

        SET var=value

Set the environment variable "var" to "value".

        COPY src_file dst_file

Copy the source file to the destination file. The src_file may have
wild card characters in it. The destination file may only be a full pathname,
or it may end in a '\' or '/' character, in which case the source file
name is used in the destination.

        ACOPY src_file dst_file

Same as the COPY command, except that the file is only copied if dst_file
does not exist or src_file has the archive bit turned on. At the _end_ of
the control file, all src_file's copied by an ACOPY have their archive bits
turned off.

        PMAKE pmake_command_line

The PMAKE command has been built into the BUILDER program. You can specify
all the same things as with PMAKE.EXE, except that the -b option is ignored.
See the PMAKE.EXE usage message for more information.


        Command Line Options
        --------------------

The following command line options are recognized:

        -c ctl_file

                Use the file "ctl_file" as the name of the control file
                to be executed, rather than the default. You can have any
                number of control files specified. BUILDER will process
                each sequentially.


        -l log_file

                Use the file "log_file" as the name of the log file where
                command output is written to in addition to being sent to
                the screen.

        -b backup_copies

                Determine the default number of backup copies of a log file
                that are to be kept.

        -v
                Verbose. Commands that are about to be executed are written
                to the screen and any log file(s) unless the command is
                prefixed by the "@" character. Those commands are never
                echoed.
        -q
                Quiet. Only a minimal amount of messages is echoed
                to the console but everything is still logged.

        -u
                Check for undefines. Print out a warning message if any
                environment variable name being looked up during macro
                substitution is not found.

        -?
                Print out the usage message.

        --
                All arguments following this are considered parameters, and
                not options.

Anything that doesn't start with a "-" (or anything at all after a "--")
are considered control file parameters. Each parameter is examined for
a "=" character. If it contains an equals sign, the environment variable name
to the left of the equals is set to the value on the right of the equals.
That is:

        BUILDER FOO=BAR

will set the environment variable "FOO" to the value "BAR". If no equals
sign is found, the ordinal position of the parameter is used as the
environment variable name and the whole of the parameter contents are used
as the value. E.g.:

        BUILDER HI_HO FOO=BAR GOODBYE

will set the following environment variables:

        1=HI_HO
        FOO=BAR
        2=GOODBYE


        Current Working Directories
        ---------------------------

Whenever a control file is opened (via the command line, or an INCLUDE
directive), the current working directory is set the same directory as
the control file. This means that the control file always has a known
starting state. Moreover, when an INCLUDE'd control file is finished, the
current working directory is reset to what ever it was before the INCLUDE
took place.
