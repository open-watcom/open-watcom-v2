User Guide for GUI Library
==========================

Overview
--------

  The GUI library is a user interface library that is designed to provide
a common API (Application Programmer's Interface) across several platforms.
The API most closely resembles the API, messaging and callback structure
used by Windows. This library is intended for internal WATCOM use.

Platforms
---------

    The operating systems currently supported are :

Character based :

DOS  (16-bit, Pharlap, DOS4G)
OS/2 (16- and 32-bit)
QNX  (16- and 32-bit)
WIN  (16-bit)
NT

Graphical :

Windows
NT
PM (16- and 32-bit) (not yet completed)

Operating systems that are intended to be supported are :

Graphical :

QNX/Windows (maybe, if demand and time exist)

  There is another library, known as AUI, which can be used in conjunction
with the GUI library.  It provides additional support for windows that
implement text display and selection.

Location
--------

  The GUI library is found on the network under cproj/gui.  The AUI library
  is found under /cproj/aui.

Functionality Provided
----------------------

  The GUI library allows the application program to create windows and process
messages, including user input message, corresponding to those windows.
The windows can display text, have menus, have floating popup menus,
display messages in message boxes and create dialogs.  The GUI library also
allows the creating of toolbars (floating and fixed) and different fonts (in
graphical environments). Controls may be created on windows (as opposed
to controls on dialogs) on all platforms.  In Windows and NT, although,
putting a group box in a window will not give good results when painting. 

* = for character mode only
+ = for graphical mode only

Functions not implemented for a certain mode will be politely stubbed out.
Use the GUIIsGUI call to determine mode.

General Information
-------------------

    Data passed in to GUI functions is not assumed to exist past when the
function call returns.  The exception to this is the 'hinttext' field of
the gui_menu_struct.  A copy of this char * is retained.  This is done to
avoid wasting memory.  When GUISetHintText is called, that char * is retained
and any previous hint text for that menu item is no longer assumed to exist.

    When the GUI library returns a piece of text, it has been allocated using
GUIAlloc and must be freed by the application.  When a buffer and length
are passed in to the GUI function, the buffer will be filled, up to length
characters, and the GUI library will not allocate any memory.  Examples
of functions which allocation memory which must be freed by the application
are : GUIGetText, GUIGetListItem, GUIGetFontInfo, GUIGetFontFromUser.  Text
is written to an existing buffer in such calls as GUIGetWindowText.

Directory structure
-------------------

gui/h - gui.h, guitypes.h, guifdlg.h and guidlg.h are intended to be included
 	by the user.

	- gui.h contains the messages, structs and API that you need
	  to get you started

	- guitypes.h contains common typedefs and constants (bool, TRUE, etc.).
	  You may want to include this if you're not defining these types
	  for yourself.

	- guifdlg.h contains the prototypes that you need to call the common
	  file dialog (as in Windows)

 	- guidlg.h contains some macros and API to make creating dialogs
	  easier

gui/ui - contains libraries to be used for character based platforms
	  (DOS, QNX, OS2, WIN and NT character based).
	- libraries created are :

	Library		OS		Memory Model	Directory 	16/32
	-------		--		------------	---------	-----

	guidosm.lib  	DOS		medium		objm		16
	guidosl.lib  	DOS		large		obj		16
	guidosf.lib	Pharlap/DOS4G	flat		objf		32
	guios2l.lib	OS2       	large		obj2		16
	guios2f.lib	OS2V2   	flat		obj2f		32
	guiqnxl.lib	QNX		large		objq		16
	guiqnxs.lib	QNX		small		obj32q		32
	guintf.lib	NT		flat		objnt		32
	guiwinl.lib	WIN		large		objw		16

gui/win - contains libraries to be used for graphical platforms (Windows, NT)
	- libraries created are :

	Library		OS		Memory Model	Directory 	16/32
	-------		--		------------	---------	-----

	guiwinm.lib	Windows		medium		objm		16
	guiwinl.lib	Windows		large		obj		16
	guintf.lib	NT		flat		objnt		32
	guipmf.lib	PM		flat		objpmf		32
	guipml.lib	PM		large		objpm		16

gui/sample - contains sample code and directories to build it in

	- gui/sample/c/sample.c and sampdef.c create a sample program that
	  uses a lot of the functionality of the GUI library.  It includes
	  gui/sample/h/sample.h.

	- gui/sample/obj* directories are set up to compile the sample
	  for several operating systems :

	DOS
	---
	  obj - DOS large memory model
	  objm - DOS medium memory model
	  objf - Pharlap/DOS4G flat memory model

	OS/2
	----
	  obj2 - OS2 16-bit large memory model
	  obj2f - OS2 32-bit flat memory model

	QNX
	---
	  objq - QNX large memory model
	  obj32q - QNX 32 bit small memory model

	Windows
	-------
	  objw - Windows large memory model
	  objwm - Windows medium memory model
	  objwc	- Windows character mode large memory model

	NT
	--
	  objnt - NT flat memory model
	  objcnt - NT character mode flat memory model

	PM
	--
	  objpmf - PM flat memory model
	  objpm - PM large memory model

Notes for compiling :

-- if you want to use the memory tracker, put the trmem project on your
   machine (from n:\utils\trmem) and set the environment variable
   trmem_dir to point to it.  Compile with TRMEM define (default).
-- set the guidir environment variable to point to the gui directory
   before trying to compile
-- you must compile ui and have the environment variable uidir set to point
   to it
-- to compile for graphics Windows or NT, set sdk_dir to point to the sdk
   directory on you machine (from n:\cproj\sdk).
-- ***when using the GUIMDIInit function call, and compiling for a graphical
   system, your app must have a .rc which include the gui.rc file found in
   /gui/win/gui.rc.  The resource compiler must also have the directive
   /i=$(sdk_dir)/misc so that it can find the bitmap indicated in gui.rc.


Messages
--------

typedef struct gui_window gui_window;
typedef bool (GUICALLBACK)( gui_window *, gui_event, void * );

When GUICreateWindow is called, a gui_window * is returned.  This is a struct
private to the GUI library and is used for communication between the
application and the GUI library.  The prototype for the callback routine is
shown above.  When it is called, it will be given a gui_window, an event
and (possibly) a third parameter, depending on the event.  Macros are
provided to extract information from the third parameter.  The following
is a description of the messages.  Descriptions of the macros are found
following the message list.  

Note :	The return codes from processing the following messages are important
	(the rest are ignored) : GUI_INIT_WINDOW and GUI_CLOSE.

typedef enum {
    GUI_NO_EVENT,	
    GUI_INIT_WINDOW,
    ...
    ...

GUI_INIT_DIALOG
	This is the first message sent to a dialog.  The app may want to
	initialize the values of controls.

GUI_NOT_ACTIVE

	another window as active through mouse or keyboard input, or
	GUIBringToFront was called for another window.

GUI_NOW_ACTIVE
	The window was not active but is now active.  Either the user
	selected this window through mouse or keyboard input or
	GUIBringToFront was called for this window.

						}		\

	Use when receiving the following messages :

	GUI_KEY_DOWN
	GUI_KEY_UP

	Takes two parameters, of type gui_key and gui_keystate which will
	be set to be the key pressed or release and they key state when
	that key was pressed or released.

GUI_GET_KEY_CONTROL :

#define GUI_GET_KEY_CONTROL( param, id, inkey )	{		\
	id = ((gui_key_control *)param)->id;			\
	inkey = (( gui_key_control *)param)->key_state.key;	\
				   		}		\

	Use when receiving the following messages :

	GUI_KEY_CONTROL
