BUILD SERVER INSTALLATION
=========================

NOTE: At the time of this writing the build server scripts assume you are using
a Windows system. Obviously this limitation should be removed at some point.

NEW: The script is changed and tested for a eCS (OS/2) System.
     Links given for OS/2 tools were valid in May 2012.
     - P4 client: ftp://ftp.perforce.com/perforce/r02.2/bin.os2/p4.exe
     - PERL:      http://download.smedley.info/perl-5.10.0-os2-20071227.zip
     - 7z:
     http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/download/pub/os2/util/archiver/p7zip-9.20.1-os2.zip

0. First install the necessary tools.
   - The latest version of Open Watcom to use as the compiler for building.
     Be sure to select ALL possible targets during the installation.
   - Whatever external help compilers are necessary.
   - The latest version of the Perforce command line client.
     For OS/2 (output from p4 -V):
         Perforce - The Fast Software Configuration Management System.
         Copyright 1995, 2002 Perforce Software.  All rights reserved.
         Rev. P4/OS2/2002.2/41879 (2003/02/24).
   - A reasonably recent version of Perl. The build scripts are written in Perl
   - For optionally creating a snapshot 7z

1. Create a folder OUTSIDE the Open Watcom source tree and copy the contents of
this folder to that folder. Do not attempt to use the system from a folder
inside the Open Watcom source tree. In this document the working copy of the
build system is assumed to be in a folder named C:\OWBUILD. However, any folder
can be used (avoid folders with spaces in their names) provided is is on the
same drive as the OW source tree.

2. Review the file config.txt and make any changes as necessary. See the
comments in the file for more information.
Create necessary directories: www\installers
                              www\reports
                              www\snapshots
Create empty files:           owbuild\bldbase1.txt
                              owbuild\bldbase2.txt
                              owbuild\bldbased.txt
3. Run the build system via 'perl dobuild.pl'. It will not run to completion as the
message base is not correct. The baseline is created next.

4. The created log files pass1.log, pass2.log and docs\build.log will serve as
your baseline. Run the program summary.pl over these

        summary c:\OW\bld\pass1.log bldbase1.txt
        summary c:\OW\bld\pass2.log bldbase2.txt
        summary c:\OW\docs\pass1.log bldbased.txt

and save the results to files such as bldbase1.txt, ...
(use the same names as you specified in config.txt).

You should verify that all messages in bldbasex.txt are normal. This build system
will compare the result of each build with this baseline and report on any
deviations. If bldbasex.txt contain serious errors, this build system will not
notice those errors in the future.

5. The scripts provided are as follows

   - summary.pl : Computes a summary of build.log that contains all the strange
     entries in the log file. Use this script to compute a baseline.

   - compare.pl : Computes the difference between a baseline summary and a new
     summary. Reports on messages that have been removed or that have been
     added in the new summary.

   - dobuild.pl : This is the main script. It prepares a batch file that does
     the build based on the current setvars.*. It cleans the source tree,
     builds the system, and then invokes summary.pl and compare.pl to check
     the results. Finally it stores a report in the reports subdirectory.

     NOTE: The build is run only if the perforce highest change number has changed.
           The highest changeno is stored in owbuild\changeno.txt. This file can
           be deleted to force a build.

     NOTE: On OS/2 the failing regression tests BLD\PLUSTEST\REGRESS\EHMIX are
           ignored and don't trigger failure.

   - common.pm : common perl routines for the other scripts

   - psummary.cmd (OS/2 only) for running summary.pl
   - pdobuild.cmd (OS/2 only) for running dobuild.pl

   - rotate.* commandfile to create snapshots *.7z and *.zip
              and to move the generated installers to www\installers
              Does NOT have access to config.txt, so adjust pathes.

Schedule dobuild.pl to run periodically using your operating system's facilities
for that purpose.

NOTE: dobuild.pl never, never, never updates the baseline summary on its own.
You must do that manually when and if you feel it is appropriate to do so. This
policy ensures that the baseline is always appropriate and that human
intelligence is used to make a judgement about when the baseline needs to be
updated.
