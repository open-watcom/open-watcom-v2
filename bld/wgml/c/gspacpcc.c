* Description: implement .pa (page)  script control word
*                        only used options are implemented
*                        i.e.   ODD EVEN and NOSTART per default
*               not implemented are the other options
*                        .pa does not check for page number changes
*                        .cc (conditional column) script control word
*                        .cp (conditional page) script control word
*                        only used options are implemented
*                        i.e. .cp numbervalue
*               note: conditional page/column appear unimplemented by wgml 4.0
