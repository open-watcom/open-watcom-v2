Open Watcom v2 Fork
===================

This document gives a quick description of the source tree layout. For more
information about the project and build instructions see the GitHub wiki.

Source Tree Layout
------------------

Open Watcom allows you to place the source tree almost anywhere (although
we recommend avoiding paths containing spaces). The root of the source
tree should be specified by the `OWROOT` environment variable in `setvars`
(as described on `Wiki` https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2/wiki/Build). All relative paths in this document are
taken relative to that location. Also this document uses the backslash
character as a path separator as is normal for DOS, Windows, and OS/2. Of
course on Linux systems a slash character should be used instead.

The directory layout is as follows:

    bld
      - The root of the build tree. Each project has a subdirectory under
        bld. For example:
          bld\cg       -> code generator
          bld\cc       -> C compiler
          bld\plusplus -> C++ compiler
          (see projects.txt for details)

    build
      - Various files used by building tools. Of most interest are the
        *.ctl files which are scripts for the builder tool (see below)
        and make files (makeint et al.).

    docs
      - Here is everything related to documentation, sources and tools.

    distrib
      - Contains manifests and scripts for building binary distribution
        packages.

    contrib
      - Third party source code which is not integral part of Open Watcom.
        This directory contains especially several DOS extenders.

    build\bin
      - This is where all build tools created during phase one are placed.

    rel
      - This is default location where the software we actually ship gets
        copied after it is built - it matches the directory structure of
        our shipping Open Watcom C/C++/FORTRAN tools. You can install the
        system by copying the rel directory to your host and then setting
        several environment variables.

        Note: the rel directory structure is created on the fly. The
        location of rel tree can be changed by `OWRELROOT` environment
        variable.
