.point Open, Multi-target Integrated Development Environment
The IDE allows you to easily edit, compile, link, debug and build
applications for 16-bit systems like DOS, OS/2 1.x, and Windows 3.x
and 32-bit systems like extended DOS, Novell NLMs, OS/2,
Windows 3.x (Win32s), Windows 95/98/Me, Windows NT/2000/XP upto Windows 11 and Linux.
Projects can be made up of multiple targets which permit a project to
include EXEs and DLLs.
The IDE produces makefiles for the project which can be viewed and
edited with a text editor.
The IDE is hosted under Windows 3.x, Windows 95/98/Me,
Windows NT/2000/XP upto Windows 11 and 32-bit OS/2.
(There is no IDE on Linux yet).

.point Cross-Platform Development Tools
.ix 'cross-platform'
The core tools in the package permit cross-platform development that
allows developers to exploit the advanced features of many well known
32-bit operating systems, including Windows 95/98/Me,
Windows NT/2000/XP upto Windows 11, OS/2 and Linux.
Cross-platform support allows you to develop on a host development
environment for execution on a different target system.
.point Multi-Platform Debugger
The new debugger advances developer productivity. New features include
redesigned interface, ability to set breakpoints on nested function
calls, improved C++ and DLL debugging, reverse execution, and
configurable interface. Graphical versions of the debugger are
available under Windows 3.x, Windows 95/98/Me,
Windows NT/2000/XP upto Windows 11, and 32-bit OS/2.
Character versions of the debugger are available under DOS,
Windows 3.x, Windows NT/2000/XP upto Windows 11, 32-bit OS/2 and Linux.
For VIDEO fans, we have kept the command line compatibility from the
original debugger.

.section Information Technical Support Will Need to Help You
.*
.np
The more information you can provide to technical support,
the faster they can help you solve your problem. A detailed description
of the problem, short sample program, and a summary of steps to duplicate
the problem (including compiler and linker options) are essential. Concise
problem reports allow technical support to quickly pinpoint the problem
and offer a resolution. Here is a list of information that will help
technical support solve the problem:
.begpoint $break
.point Contact information
We would like your name, as well as your email adress, where you can be reached.
.point Product information
Please tell us the product name and exact version number.
.point Hardware configuration
Please tell us what type of processor you are using (e.g., 2.2GHz
Intel Pentium 4), how much memory is present, what kind of graphics
adapter you are using, and how much memory it has.
.point Software configuration
Please tell us what operating system and version you are using.
.point Concise problem report with short sample program
Please provide a complete description of the problem and the steps to
reproduce it. A small, self-contained program example with compile and
link options is ideal.
