:DT.pre_lines
:I2 refid='lapre_l'.lapre_l
:DD.This attribute accepts vertical space units.
    A zero value means that no lines are skipped.
    If the skip value is a line unit,
    it is multiplied by the current line spacing
    (see :HDREF refid='specver'. for more information).
    The resulting number of lines are skipped before the
    &local.
If the document entity starts a new page, the specified number of
lines are still skipped.
The pre-lines value is not merged with the previous document entity's
post-skip value.
