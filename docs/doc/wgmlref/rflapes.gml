:DT.pre_skip
:I2 refid='lapre_s'.lapre_s
:DD.This attribute accepts vertical space units.
    A zero value means that no lines are skipped.
    If the skip value is a line unit,
    it is multiplied by the current line spacing
    (see :HDREF refid='specver'. for more information).
    The resulting amount of space is skipped before the
    &local.
The pre-skip will be merged with the previous document entity's
post-skip value.
If a pre-skip occurs at the beginning of an output page, the
pre-skip value has no effect.
