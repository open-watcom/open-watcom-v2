:H3.Saving Options
:P.
After modifying the options and selecting device and symbol information,
the document may be processed.
However,
performing this procedure every time you wish to process the document
would be tedious, and likely result in a mistake.
Saving the options for future use will allow you to reset all of the
options easily.
:P.
If you are still in the symbol definitions screen, press &g_enter. twice
to return to the main document screen.
Select &menu.Save current options&emenu. from the &menu.Options&emenu. menu.
The name of the current option file is displayed in the file name
area of a browser screen.
Enter the name &mono.formletr.opt&emono.\.
The screen should appear as follows:
.screen 'froptsv' 'Save the current options'
:P.
Pressing &g_enter. will save the options into the specified file.
:H4.Selecting New Options
:P.
Selecting &menu.Select a new set of options&emenu.
from the &menu.Options&emenu. menu
will present an options file browser.
You may select an existing option file to reset the current options.
:H4.Default Options
:P.
When &WGML. starts (both WGMLUI and WGML), the special option
file &mono.default.opt&emono. is searched for on the disk.
If found, it is loaded before any other options are processed.
The default option file may contain small option adjustments from
which other option files are based, or contain major changes as
demonstrated by the options entered through this
tutorial.
Placing a &mono.default.opt&emono. file in directories containing
similar documents can remove the need to load different option files
for different situations.
Select &menu.Make current options the default&emenu.
from the &menu.Options&emenu. menu
to make the current options your default.
:P.
If you have different option files for different documents in one
directory, you can load an option file and make it your default
when you are going to work on a document over a period of time.
