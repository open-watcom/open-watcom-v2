.chap Project Overview
.*
This document serves as an introduction and a guide for developers of
the Open Watcom compilers and tools. It is not particularly useful for
the users (who are also developers) of Open Watcom compilers &mdash
they are encouraged to read the User's Guide, Programmer's Guide,
C Language Reference and other user oriented books.
.np
It should not be assumed that this book is in any way final or the
ultimate reference. Readers are encouraged to add, change and modify this
document to better reflect evolution of the Open Watcom project.

.section History
.*
.np
.ix 'history'
.ix 'WATFOR'
The history of the Open Watcom project is rather long, in terms of
Interned years it would probably span millennia. The origins can be
traced back to 1965. That summer a team of undergraduate students
at the University of Waterloo develped a FORTRAN compiler (called
WATFOR) that ran on the University's IBM 7040 systems. The compiler
was soon ported to IBM 360 and later to the famous DEC PDP-11.
.np
.ix 'WATFOR-77'
In early 1980s a brand new version of the compiler was created
that supported the FORTRAN 77 language. It ran on two platforms,
the IBM 370 and the emerging IBM PC. The PC version of WATFOR-77
was finished in 1985 and in the same year support for Japanese was
added. In 1986, WATFOR-77 was ported to the QNX operating system.
.np
The early compilers were written in a portable language called
WSL or Watcom Systems Language. In late 1980s the developers
rewrote the existing code in C and from then on all new developments
were done on C, later with traces of C++ here and there.
.np
In parallel to the FORTRAN compilers Watcom developed optimizing
C compilers. When the first PC version (Watcom C 6.0) was introduced
in 1987, it immediately attracted attention by producing faster code
than other compilers available at that time.
.np
In 1988 work started on an advanced highly optimizing code generator
that supported both the C language and FORTRAN and was portable across
multiple platforms. Generation of tight code, availability on multiple
platforms (DOS, Windows, OS/2 and Windows NT in one package) and the
ability to cross-compile made Watcom C and C++ compilers quite popular
in mid-1990s. Around 1993-1996, nearly all DOS games were developed
with Watcom C, including famous titles such as DOOM, Descent or Duke
Nukem 3D.
.np
.ix 'VX-REXX'
Watcom International, Inc. had other successful products besides its
highly acclaimed compilers. VX-REXX was a popular GUI RAD tool for
OS/2 and Watcom SQL was a cross-platform "embeddable" SQL database.
.np
.ix 'PowerSoft'
In mid-1990s, Watcom International, Inc. was acquired by PowerSoft, the
maker of Power++, PowerDesigner and other GUI RAD tools for the Windows
platform. PowerSoft used Watcom compiler technology as a back-end for
their GUI tools besides continuing to market and develop existing
Watcom tools.
.np
.ix 'Sybase'
PowerSoft itself had merged with Sybase, Inc. in 1994. PowerSoft's
development tools nicely complemented Sybase's database servers.
Sybase was also interested in Watcom SQL which was enhanced and turned
into Sybase SQL Anywhere.
.np
Sybase continued to sell Watcom C/C++ and FORTRAN compilers version 11 but
it was obvious that Sybase couldn't compete with Microsoft in the
languages market. Sybase decided to end-of-life the Watcom compilers
effective 2000.
.np
.ix 'SciTech'
But that's not the end of the story. Many customers did not want to give
up the Watcom compilers because there was no suitable replacement in many
areas. One of these customers was Kendall Bennett of SciTech Software, Inc.
SciTech entered into negotiations with Sybase and in an unprecedented move,
Sybase agreed upon open sourcing the Watcom compilers and tools. One of
the reasons why this was possible at all was the fact that Watcom had very
little reliance on third-party tools and source code and had developed
practically everything in-house, from YACC to IDE.
.np
The process of opening the source was longer than originally anticipated
(all software related projects tend to work out this way for some
inexplicable reason) but in the first half of 2002, the source was finally
made available under the Sybase Open Watcom Public License version 1.0.
.*
.section Guided Tour
.*
.np
This section will take you on a guided tour of the Open Watcom source tree,
presenting an overview of its structure and highlighting some of the more
memorable sights.
.np
The Open Watcom directory structure mostly mirrors the layout used by
the Watcom/Sybase build server but it has been cleaned up, straightened
out and unified, although there still may be some warts.
.np
The root of the Open Watcom directory tree can be in the root of
any drive (if your OS uses drive letters) or in any directory, for
instance
.id e:\ow
.period
Long filenames are not recommended if compatibility with DOS tools is
desired. Directory names which include spaces are highly discouraged in
any case.
.np
The main subdirectories in the Open Watcom root are the following:
.begnote
.note build
contains main builder control files and other useful files.
One extremely important file lives here:
.us makeinit.
This file controls the operation of wmake and is the key to understanding
of the build process. Since wmake looks for
.us makeinit
along the
.id PATH
.ct , the
.us build
directory should be placed at or near the start of your
.id PATH
environment variable.
.note build/binbuild
contains binaries created during first build phase (bootstrap) and used during
main building process (second build phase).
.note build/mif
contains all main make files (global).
.note bld
is
.us the
directory where it's at. It contains all the Open Watcom source code. It is
so important (and huge) that it deserves its own section.
.note docs
contains source files for the Open Watcom documentation as well as binaries
needed to translate the sources into PostScript, HTML or various online
help formats. The source files of this document are stored under this directory.
For more information please refer the the chapter entitled Documentation
later in this manual.
.note rel
is the "release" directory is where the binaries and other files produced
in the course of the build process end up. The structure of this directory
mirrors the
.us WATCOM
directory of a typical Open Watcom installation.
.endnote
.*
.section The bld directory

.np
As you can see, there's a lot of stuff! Some of these projects
contain specific documentation pertaining to them, usually located
in a directory called 'doc' or somesuch. For the most
part, the truly uptodate and comprehensive documentation is the
source code.
.*
.chap First Steps
.*
This chapter briefly describes the prerequisite steps necessary
to build and/or contribute to the Open Watcom project &mdash how
to get the source code and how to set up the build environment.
.*
.section Connecting up
.*
.np
.ix 'Perforce'
The most uptodate version of the Open Watcom source code lives on the
Open Watcom Perforce server. It is possible to go straight to the
Perforce repository but most people will find it much easier to
get a source archive first. The source archives can be found
at the "Open Watcom Web site",
.id &owurl.
along with latest information on Perforce setup. You will generally
need a working installation of the previous release of Open Watcom
C/C++ and some free disk space to burn (one gigabyte should do).
.np
The Open Watcom source tree can be located in any directory
on any drive. After extracting the source archive you will find
a very important batch file called
.us setvars
in your Open Watcom root directory. This will set up a bunch of
necessary environment variables but first you'll have to edit it
to reflect your directory structure etc. It also contains the
necessary Perforce settings.
.np
Now is the time to connect to Perforce. Again, most uptodate
information can be found on the Open Watcom web site. If you followed
the instructions correctly, no servers are down and no other unpredictable
(or maybe predictable) things happened, you will have brought your source
tree to the latest revision (aka tip or head revision).
.*
.section Gearing up for Building
.*
.np
.ix 'builder'
.ix 'pmake'
Before you start building the Open Watcom tools proper, you will need to
build several helper tools:
.us builder, pmake, cdsay
and a few others. These tools have to be built manually because the build
process won't work without them.
.np
The tools can be found in appropriately named subdirectory of the
.us bld
directory, which is named
.us builder
(showing complete lack of imagination).
.np
To build the required executables, go to a subdirectory of the project
.us builder
directory which sounds like it would be appropriate for your host platform
and run
.us wmake.
If you set up everything correctly, you will end up with working binaries
that were automatically copied into the right subdirectory of the
.us build
directory, and that directory is already on the
.id PATH
.period
If not, it's back to square one &mdash the most likely source of problems
is incorrectly set up
.us setvars
batch file.
.np
If you've got this far &mdash congratulations, you've finished the one-time
steps. You shouldn't need to redo them unless you decide to start from scratch,
your harddrive decides to die or some similarly catastrophic event occurs.
.np
You should now read the next chapter that describes the build architecture
and also lists the magic incantations necessary to invoke builds.
