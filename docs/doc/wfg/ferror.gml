.bi expecting INTEGER, REAL, or DOUBLE PRECISION expression
.pc
The indicated expression is not one of type INTEGER, REAL, or DOUBLE
PRECISION.
Each expression following the DO variable must be an expression of
one of these types.
.note SX-19
.bi expecting INTEGER or CHARACTER constant
.pc
In the PAUSE and STOP statement, the name following the keyword must
be a constant of type INTEGER or of type CHARACTER.
This constant will be printed on the console when the statement is
executed.
.note SX-20
.bi unexpected operator
.pc
An operand was expected but none was found.
For example, in an I/O statement, the comma is used to separate I/O
list items.
Two consecutive commas without an I/O list item between them would
result in this error.
.note SX-21
.bi no closing quote on literal string
.pc
The closing quote of a literal string was not found before the end of
the statement.
.note SX-22
.bi missing or invalid constant
.pc
In a DATA statement, the constant required to initialize a variable
was not found or incorrectly specified.
.note SX-23
.bi expecting character constant
.pc
A character constant is required.

.bi length specification before array declarator is not FORTRAN 77 standard
.pc
An array declarator specified immediately after the length
specification of the array is an extension to the FORTRAN 77
language.
.note TY-02
.bi %d1 is an illegal length for %s2 type
.pc
The length specifier %d1 is not valid for the type %s2.
For type LOGICAL, valid lengths are 1 and 4.
For the type INTEGER, valid lengths are 1, 2, and 4.
For the type REAL, valid lengths are 4 and 8.
For the type COMPLEX, valid lengths are 8 and 16.
On the IBM PC, the length specifier for items of type CHARACTER must
be greater than 0 and not exceed 65535.
.note TY-03
.bi length specifier in %s1 statement is not FORTRAN 77 standard
.pc
A length specifier in certain type specification statements is an
extension to the FORTRAN 77 language.
These include: LOGICAL*1, LOGICAL*4, INTEGER*1, INTEGER*2, INTEGER*4,
REAL*4, REAL*8, COMPLEX*8, and COMPLEX*16.
.note TY-04
.bi length specification not allowed with type %s1
.pc
A length specification is not allowed in a DOUBLE PRECISION or
DOUBLE COMPLEX statement.
.note TY-05
.bi type of %s1 has already been established as %s2
.pc
The indicated name %s1 has already been declared to have a different
type, namely %s2.
The name %s1 cannot be used in this specification statement.
.note TY-06
.bi type of %s1 has not been declared
.pc
The indicated name %s1 has not been declared.
This message is only issued when the IMPLICIT NONE specification
statement is used.
.note TY-07
.bi %s1 of type %s2 is illegal in %s3 statement
.pc
The symbol %s1 with type %s2 cannot be used in statement %s3.
For example, a symbol of type STRUCTURE cannot be used in a PARAMETER
statement.

.bi substring (%d1:%d2) of expression on right side of equal sign is undefined
.pc
The substring (%d1:%d2) has been used on the right hand side of an
expression and its value is undefined.
A value must be assigned to the variable name or array element name
before it can be used in an expression.
.note UV-02
.bi substring (%d1:%d2) of return value of character function %s3 is undefined
.pc
The character function %s3 has been referenced and the function name
has not been assigned a value in the function.
The substring (%d1:%d2) does not have a value.
.note UV-03
.bi substring (%d1:%d2) of an operand in a relational expression is undefined
.pc
The substring (%d1:%d2) has been used in a relational expression and
has not previously been assigned a value.
.note UV-04
.bi substring (%d1:%d2) of an argument to an intrinsic function is undefined
.pc
The substring (%d1:%d2), which is an actual argument to an intrinsic
function, does not have a value assigned to it.
.note UV-05
.bi the value of %s1 is undefined
.pc
The variable name %s1 has been used in a statement and a value has not
yet been assigned to it.
All variables must first be initialized through the use of statements
or data initialization in specification statements.
.note UV-06
.bi argument number %d1 passed to intrinsic function is undefined
.pc
The actual argument number %d1 does not have a value assigned to it.

The name %s2 has been defined as %s1 and cannot be used as a name in
the statement %s3.
.note VA-02
.bi symbolic name %s1 is longer than 6 characters
.pc
Symbolic names greater than 6 characters is an extension to the
FORTRAN 77 language.
The maximum length is 32 characters.
.note VA-03
.bi %s1 has already been defined as a %s2
.pc
The name %s1 has been previously defined as a %s2 in another
statement and cannot be redefined as specified in the indicated
statement.
.note VA-04
.bi %s1 %s2 has not been defined
.pc
The name %s2 has been referenced to be a %s1 but has not been defined
as such in the program unit.
.note VA-05
.bi %s1 is an unreferenced symbol
.pc
The name %s1 has been defined but not referenced.
.note VA-06
.bi %s1 already belongs to this NAMELIST group
.pc
The name %s1 can only appear in a NAMELIST group once.
However, a name can belong to multiple NAMELIST groups.
.note VA-07
.bi %s1 has been used but not defined
.pc
%s1 has not been defined before using it in a way that requires its
definition.
Note that symbols that are equivalenced, belong to a common block, are
dummy arguments, or passed as an argument to a subprogram, will not be
checked to ensure that they have been defined before requiring a value.
