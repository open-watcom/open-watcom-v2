:P.
Because the &fn. manipulates
:MONO.static
member data, its behavior is not tied to any one object but affects the
entire class of objects.
The value that is returned by the &fn. is valid for all
objects of all classes derived from the &cls.:PERIOD.
No subsequent call to the &fn. will return the same value as a previous call.
