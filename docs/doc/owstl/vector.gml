.sect Introduction
.*
The class template
:CLASS.std::~vector
provides a dynamic array of objects with a type given by the type parameter.
Unlike
:CLASS.std::~string
vectors can be instantiated with non-POD types. This complicates the
implementation of
:CLASS.std::~vector
considerably, as discussed below.

Most of the required functionality has been implemented. Some of the methods are
not yet exception safe.

.section Design Details
.np
The internal structure of
:CLASS.vector
is very similar to that of
:CLASS.string.
Any enhancement or bug fix applied to either of these templates should be
reviewed for possible application to the other. Like a string a vector allocates
more raw memory than it needs. This allows the logical size of the vector to
increase without necessarily requiring a reallocation of memory. However, unlike
a string, a vector can contain objects with user defined
copy constructors and user defined
:CODE.operator=.
In addition, copying and assigning objects in a vector might cause an exception
to be thrown. These details make implementing :CLASS.vector more difficult than
implementing
:CLASS.string.
.np
For example, consider a vector of size 100 with 200 units of memory allocated.
Now suppose that 10 new objects are inserted in the middle of this vector. The
10 objects at the end of the vector need to be copying onto the raw memory just
past the end using a copy constructor. However, the other objects that are moved
will be placed on top of existing objects and thus must be copied with an
:CODE.operator=.
.np
If an exception occurs while the new objects are being constructed, the objects
constructed so far can be destroyed and the vector can be left in an unmodified
state. However, if an exception occurs after the new objects have been created
but during the assignment of the remaining objects it is somewhat unclear how to
best proceed. If the new objects are destroyed data may be lost since the
original copies of those objects may have already been overwritten. Yet trying
to restore the vector to its initial state is probably unwise; if an exception
has occurred while copying objects around, further copying is unlikely to be
successful. There is little choice but to leave the vector in a corrupted,
partially modified state.
