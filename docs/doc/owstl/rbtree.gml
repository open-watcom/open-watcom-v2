Template class
:CLASS.std::~_ow::~RedBlackTree<>
is an implementation of a red-black tree data structure.
It is used as a common base for
:CLASS.std::~set
and
:CLASS.std::~map.
It can be found in
:PATH.hdr/watcom/_rbtree.mh.
The intention was to allow easy replacement and experimentation with other
implementations such as an AVL tree or perhaps some sort of relaxed chromatic
tree suited to concurrent systems.

.section Design Details
.np
:CLASS.template < class Key, class Compare, class Allocator, class ValueWrapper >
:CLASS.class RedBlackTree
.np
:CLASS.Key
is the type that is used to index the tree;
:CLASS.Compare
is a functor (class with operator() defined) that provides ordering to the keys;
:CLASS.Allocator
provides the memory allocation;
:CLASS.ValueWrapper
is a class that defines the type of the objects stored in the tree and provides
an operator() that knows how to extract the key from that type.
:CLASS.ValueWrapper
allows the same tree code to apply to sets where the key is the only thing
stored and maps where the object stored has a key and a mapped value.
.*
.sect Relation to map and set
.*
:CLASS.std::~set
and :CLASS.std::~map
take their base class as a template parameter.
They select the appropriate value wrapper and inherit all the functionality.
The base currently defaults to RedBlackTree and is the only implementation
available.

.sect Description of a Red-Black Tree
.*
A red-black tree is a ordered binary tree. A binary tree is made up of nodes,
where each node can have up to two children. An ordered binary tree orders the
nodes so that a left child is less than its parent and a right child is greater.
It could be the other way around, and this implementation uses a comparison
function and puts the child on the left if compare( child, parent ) evaluates
true. If a node has no children it is a leaf, otherwise it is an internal node.
Some implementations only hold the actual data in the leaves and the internal
nodes are just place holders. This implementation has imaginary leaves - null
pointers. If a node's child pointer is null then that non-existent child is a
leaf, and we hold all the data in the real, existing nodes. Therefore there is
no special leaf node type, just a null pointer if there is no child with data.
.np
A red-black tree adds a color to ever node, and defines some rules that mean the
tree stays balanced. A tree is balanced if the difference between the largest
and smallest depth of a leaf is bounded. The invariants are:
:UL.
:LI.Every red node has a black parent
:LI.Every route from the root node to a node with 0 or 1 children has the same
number of black nodes
:LI.Every leaf is black (note this is assumed as leaves don't really exist in
this implementation.)
:LI.The root is black
:eUL.
.np

.sect Overview of the class
.*
The tree class defines an internal Node structure that is made up of the object
stored in the tree, Node pointers for the parent and left and right children,
and the Node color. There is an allocator member object, mMem, that is rebound
to allocate Node types. There are pointers to the root and furthest left and
right nodes. These are used to mark were to start the search, and create the
begin and end iterators respectively. The iterator and const_iterator are member
classes derived from a common member class. There is an &company extension
method
:FUNC.bool _Sane()
that checks the integrity of the data structure.
Related to this is a integer mError member that is assigned a value if an
error is detected when _Sane is run.
:CMT to do: make a 'for review' tag?
[for review] This should perhaps be renamed _Error or made private and
a _GetError() method provided.
.*
.sect Inserting Elements and Rebalancing
.*
The
:FUNC.insert
method calls
:FUNC.unbalancedInsert
and
:FUNC.insBalTransform.
The loop in
:FUNC.unBalancedInsert
moves from child to child searching for the leaf of the tree where the new item
can be inserted, in a similar way as the find algorithm checks for the item. A
final check is made at the end of the loop to see if the key already exists. If
it doe, an iterator to the existing key is returned. Otherwise, a new node is
allocated and constructed. The Node is linked into the tree at the place found.
A try-catch is placed around the construction of the node to deallocate the node
again if any exceptions are raised. This is needed to stop a memory leak that
could occur because the memory has been allocated but the exception has stopped
the Node being linked in to the tree (so it would never get destroyed when the
tree is destroyed).
.np
At this point the tree is a valid binary tree but not necessarily obeying the
red-black balance criteria. The new node is painted red so as not to invalidate
the black-height rule, but this may introduce a violation of the red-red rule.
:FUNC.insBalTransform
is called with a pointer to the newly inserted node to correct this. This is
where this implementation of a red-black tree varies from the most common
implementations. Usually the balancing procedure is broken down into a series of
:Q.rotations:eQ. where a subtree of the tree would appear to be rotated if
represented graphically. These rotations can be left or right and the procedure
moves up to the parent subtree and is repeated until the violation is removed.
.np
Instead &company uses the concept of a :Q.transformation:eQ..
:CMT figure out/make reference tag
[Alternatives to Two Classic Data Structures, Chris Okaski, 2005?] A sub-branch
of the tree is analyzed to see which case it matches and the elements in that
branch are then reorganized and recolored in one block of code. Although this
isn't wildly different it was hoped that it would allow a faster algorithm to be
created because larger sub-trees and special cases could be matched and
manipulated in one go, and the code generator may be able to make a better job
of optimizing the code because a larger block of manipulating instructions would
be together. Whether this was a good decision will be born out in time.
.np
Explain why the insert methods are currently inline - compiler bug - what
exactly was the problem?
.*
.sect Deleting Elements
.*
Deletion is a bit more complicated than insertion. The main method that gets
called is
:FUNC.erase( iterator ).
I did hope it may be possible to rewrite this in a way that is easier to
understand. There are two main cases:
:OL.
:LI.The node to be removed has both children
:LI.The node has one or more children null (i.e. has 0 or 1 real child,
in other words 1 or 2 leaves) - I've called this an :Q.end node:eQ.
:eOL.
If it is an :Q.end node:eQ. (has 0 or 1 real child) then that child can be
linked into it's place or the node can just be deleted. We take note of the
deleted node's parent, the child, and its color. The other case where it has 2
children is more complicated. We swap the predecessor (which cannot have a right
child by definition) of the deleted node into the place of the deleted node, and
change its color so that part of the tree is still valid. The node being removed
is now effectively the predecessors old position, so we take note of its
original child, parent and color.
:P.
Now we have created a situation where we are really removing an :Q.end node:eQ.
(0 or 1 real child). We can look at the color of the node to be removed, if it
is red then there is no violation of the black height rule by removing it. Also
it cannot have a real child so there is nothing to link in its place. If the
removed :Q.end node:eQ. is black there are two cases. If it has a child that
child must be red or there would have been a black height violation, thus we
link the child in the place and paint it black to maintain the black height. If
there was no child we have created a black height problem - there is a lack of
black on this branch. The deleted node has left a null leaf node in its place,
we usually count these as black, but in this case we have to call it double
black to resolve the black height problem.
This isn't valid so we call
:FUNC.doubleBlackTransform()
to run through a set of cases to rearrange subtrees and remove the need for
double black.
