.section Compiler Options - Full Description
.*
.np
.ix 'compiling options'
In the following sections, we present complete descriptions of
compiler options organized into categories.
.*
.beglevel
.*
.section Target Specific
.*
.np
This group of options deals with characteristics of the target
application;
for example, simple executables versus Dynamic Link Libraries,
character-mode versus graphical user interface,
single-threaded versus multi-threaded,
and so on.
.*
:OPTLIST.
.*
.if &e'&$SWbc eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWbc' name='bc'.
.ix 'options' 'bc'
.ix 'console application'
(OS/2, Win16/32 only)
This option causes the compiler to emit into the object file
references to the appropriate startup code for a character-mode
console application.
The presence of
.id LibMain/DLLMain
or
.id WinMain/wWinMain
in the source code does not influence the selection of startup code.
Only
.id main
and
.id wmain
are significant.
.np
If none of "bc", "bd", "bg" or "bw" are specified then the order of
priority in determining which combination of startup code and
libraries to use are as follows.
.autonote
.note
The presence of one of
.id LibMain
or
.id DLLMain
implies that the DLL startup code and libraries should be used.
.note
The presence of
.id WinMain
or
.id wWinMain
implies that the GUI startup code and libraries should be used.
.note
The presence of
.id main
or
.id wmain
implies that the default startup code and libraries should be used.
.endnote
.np
If both a wide and non-wide version of an entry point are specified,
the "wide" entry point will be used.
Thus
.id wWinMain
is called when both
.id WinMain
and
.id wWinMain
are present.
Similarly,
.id wmain
is called when both
.id main
and
.id wmain
are present (and
.id WinMain/wWinMain
are not present).
By default, if both
.id wmain
and
.id WinMain
are included in the source code, then the startup code will attempt
to call
.id wWinMain
(since both "wide" and "windowed" entry points were included).
.if '&target' eq 'QNX' .do begin
This option does not apply to QNX.
.do end
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWbd eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWbd' name='bd'.
.ix 'options' 'bd'
.ix 'dynamic link library'
.ix 'DLL'
.ix '__DLLstart_'
(OS/2, Win16/32 only)
This option causes the compiler to emit into the object file
references to the run-time DLL startup code (reference to the
.id __DLLstart_
symbol) and, if required, special
versions of the run-time libraries that support DLLs. The presence of
.id main/wmain
or
.id WinMain/wWinMain
in the source code does not influence the selection of startup code.
Only
.id LibMain
and
.id DLLMain
are significant
:optref refid='SWbc'..
If you are building a DLL with statically linked C runtime (the default),
it is recommended that you compile at least one of its object files with
the "bd" switch to ensure that the DLL's C runtime is properly initialized.
.ix 'predefined macros' 'see macros'
.ix 'macros' '__SW_BD'
The macro
.kwm __SW_BD
will be predefined if "bd" is selected.
.if '&target' eq 'QNX' .do begin
This option does not apply to QNX.
.do end
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWbg eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWbg' name='bg'.
.ix 'options' 'bg'
.ix 'console application'
(OS/2, Win16/32 only)
This option causes the compiler to emit into the object file
references to the appropriate startup code for a windowed (GUI)
application.
The presence of
.id LibMain/DLLMain
or
.id main/wmain
in the source code does not influence the selection of startup code.
Only
.id WinMain
and
.id wWinMain
are significant
:optref refid='SWbc'..
.if '&target' eq 'QNX' .do begin
This option does not apply to QNX.
.do end
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWbm eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWbm' name='bm'.
.ix 'options' 'bm'
(Netware, OS/2, Win32 only)
This option causes the compiler to emit into the object file
references to the appropriate multi-threaded library name(s).
.ix 'macros' '_MT'
.ix 'macros' '__SW_BM'
The macros
.kwm _MT
and
.kwm __SW_BM
will be predefined if "bm" is selected.
.if '&target' eq 'QNX' .do begin
This option does not apply to QNX.
.do end
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWbr eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWbr' name='br'.
.ix 'options' 'br'
(OS/2, Win32 only)
This option causes the compiler to emit into the object file
references to the run-time DLL library name(s).
The run-time DLL libraries are special subsets of the &product
run-time libraries that are available as DLLs.
When you use this option with an OS/2 application, you must also
specify the "CASEEXACT" option to the &lnkname..
.ix 'macros' '_DLL'
.ix 'macros' '__SW_BR'
The macros
.kwm _DLL
and
.kwm __SW_BR
will be predefined if "br" is selected.
.if '&target' eq 'QNX' .do begin
This option does not apply to QNX.
.do end
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWbt eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWbt' name='bt'.[=<os>]
.ix 'options' 'bt'
This option causes the compiler to define the "build" target.
This option is used for cross-development work.
It prevents the compiler from defining the default build target (which
is based on the host system the compiler is running on).
The default build targets are:
.begnote
.note DOS
when the host operating system is DOS,
.note OS2
when the host operating system is OS/2,
.note NT
when the host operating system is Windows NT (including Windows 95),
.note QNX
when the host operating system is QNX.
or
.note LINUX
when the host operating system is Linux.
.endnote
.np
It also prevents the compiler from defining the default target macro.
Instead the compiler defines a macro consisting of the string "<os>"
converted to uppercase and prefixed and suffixed with two underscores.
The default target macros are described in the
section entitled :HDREF refid='wccmacs'..
.np
For example, specifying the option:
.millust begin
bt=foo
.millust end
.pc
would cause the compiler to define the macro
.millust begin
__FOO__
.millust end
.pc
and prevent it from defining
.kwm MSDOS
.ct ,
.kwm _DOS
and
.kwm __DOS__
if the compiler was being run under DOS,
.kwm __OS2__
if using the OS/2 hosted compiler,
.kwm __NT__
if using the Windows NT or Windows 95 hosted compiler,
.kwm __QNX__
and
.kwm __UNIX__
if using the QNX hosted version.
or
.kwm __LINUX__
and
.kwm __UNIX__
if using the Linux hosted version.
Any string consisting of letters, digits, and the underscore character
may be used for the target name.
.np
The compiler will also construct an environment variable called
.ev <os>_INCLUDE
and see if it has been defined.
If the environment variable is defined then each directory listed in
it is searched (in the order that they were specified).
For example, the environment variable
.ev WINDOWS_INCLUDE
will be searched if
.sy bt=WINDOWS
option was specified.
.exam begin 1
&setcmd. windows_include=&pc.watcom&pc.h&pc.win
.exam end
.np
Include file processing is described in the
section entitled :HDREF refid='wccinc'..
.np
Several target names are recognized by the compiler and perform
additional operations.
.begnote $setptnt 10
.notehd1 Target name
.notehd2 Additional operation
.note DOS
Defines the macros
.kwm _DOS
and
.kwm MSDOS
.period
.note WINDOWS
Same as specifying one of the "zw" options.
Defines the macros
.kwm _WINDOWS
(16-bit only)
and
.kwm __WINDOWS_386__
(32-bit only).
.note NETWARE
(32-bit only)
Causes the compiler to use stack-based calling conventions.
Also defines the macro
.kwm __NETWARE_386__
.period
.note QNX
Defines the macro
.kwm __UNIX__
.period
.note LINUX
Defines the macro
.kwm __UNIX__
.period
.endnote
.np
Specifying "bt" with no target name following restores the default
target name.
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWbw eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWbw' name='bw'.
.ix 'options' 'bw'
(Win16 only)
This option causes the compiler to import a special symbol so that the
default windowing library code is linked into your application.
The presence of
.id LibMain/DLLMain
in the source code does not influence the selection of startup code.
Only
.id main
.ct ,
.id wmain
.ct ,
.id WinMain
and
.id wWinMain
are significant
:optref refid='SWbc'..
.ix 'macros' '__SW_BW'
The macro
.kwm __SW_BW
will be predefined if "bw" is selected.
.if '&target' eq 'QNX' .do begin
This option does not apply to QNX.
.do end
.do end
.*


.if &e'&$SWof eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWof' name='of'.
.ix 'options' 'of'
This option selects the generation of traceable stack frames for those
functions that contain calls or require stack frame setup.
.np
&286only.
To use &company's "Dynamic Overlay Manager" (DOS only), you must
compile all modules using one of the "of" or "of+" options ("of" is
sufficient).
.np
For near functions, the following function prologue sequence is
generated.
.millust begin
&286only.
    push BP
    mov  BP,SP

&386only.
    push EBP
    mov  EBP,ESP
.millust end

&386only.
    inc  EBP
    push EBP
    mov  EBP,ESP
.millust end
.pc
The BP/EBP value on the stack will be even or odd depending on the
code model.
.np
For 16-bit DOS systems, the Dynamic Overlay Manager uses this
information to determine if the return address on the stack is a short
address (16-bit offset) or long address (32-bit segment:offset).
.np
Do not use this option for 16-bit Windows applications.
.ix '_export functions'
It will alter the code sequence generated for "_export" functions.
.exam begin 1
&prompt.:SF font=1.compiler_name:eSF. toaster &sw.of

.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWofpls eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWofpls' name='of+'.
.ix 'options' 'of+'
This option selects the generation of traceable stack frames for all
functions regardless of whether they contain calls or require stack
frame setup.
This option is intended for developers of embedded systems (ROM-based
applications).
.np

.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWsg eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWsg' name='sg'.
.ix 'stack growing'
.ix 'options' 'sg'
This option is useful for 32-bit OS/2 and Win32 multi-threaded
applications.
It requests the code generator to emit a run-time call at the start of
any function that has more than 4K bytes of automatic variables
(variables located on the stack).
.np
.ix 'guard page'
.ix 'primary thread'
.ix 'threads' 'growing the stack'
.ix 'guard page'
Under 32-bit OS/2, the stack is grown automatically in 4K pages for
any threads,
other than the primary thread, using the stack "guard page" mechanism.
The stack consists of in-use committed pages topped off with a special
guard page.
A memory reference into the 4K guard page causes the operating system
to grow the stack by one 4K page and to add a new 4K guard page.
This works fine when there is less than 4K of automatic variables in a
function.
When there is more than 4K of automatic data, the stack must be grown
in an orderly fashion, 4K bytes at a time, until the stack has grown
sufficiently to accommodate all the automatic variable storage
requirements.
Hence the requirement for a stack-growing run-time routine.
.ix '__GRO' 'stack growing'
The stack-growing run-time routine is called
.id __GRO
.period
.np
The "stack=" linker option specifies how much stack is available and
committed for the primary thread when an executable starts.
The stack size parameter to
.mono _beginthread()
specifies how much stack is available for a child thread.
The child thread starts with just 4k of stack committed.
The stack will not grow to be bigger than the size specified by the
stack size parameter.
.np
Under 32-bit Windows (Win32), the stack is grown automatically in 4K
pages for all threads using a similar stack "guard page" mechanism.
The stack consists of in-use committed pages topped off with a special
guard page.
The techniques for growing the stack in an orderly fashion are the
same as that described above for OS/2.
.np
The "stack=" linker option specifies how much stack is available for
the primary thread when an executable starts.
The "commit stack=" linker directive specifies how much of that stack
is committed when the executable starts.
If no "commit stack=" directive is used, it defaults to the same value
as the stack size.
The stack size parameter to
.mono _beginthread()
specifies how much stack is committed for a child thread.
If the size is set to zero, the size of the primary thread stack is
used for the child thread stack.
When the child thread executes, the stack space is not otherwise
restricted.
.np
.ix 'macros' '__SW_SG'
The macro
.kwm __SW_SG
will be predefined if "sg" is selected.
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWst eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWst' name='st'.
.ix 'stack touching'
.ix 'options' 'st'
This option causes the code generator to ensure that the first reference
to the stack in a function is to the stack "bottom" using the SS register.
If the memory for this part of the stack is not mapped to the task, a
memory fault will occur involving the SS register.
This permits an operating system
to allocate additional stack space to the faulting task.
.np
Suppose that a function requires 100 bytes of stack space.
The code generator usually emits an instruction sequence to reduce the
stack pointer by the required number of bytes of stack space, thereby
establishing a new stack bottom.
When the "st" option is specified, the code generator will ensure
that the first reference to the stack is to a memory location
with the lowest address.
If a memory fault occurs, the operating system can determine that it
was a stack reference (since the SS register is involved) and also
how much additional stack space is required.
.np
See the description of the "sg" option for a more general solution to
the stack allocation problem.
.ix 'macros' '__SW_ST'
The macro
.kwm __SW_ST
will be predefined if "st" is selected.

Normally, a callback function cannot be called directly.
You must use MakeProcInstance to obtain a function pointer with which

.np
This group of options deals with all the forms of debugging
information that can be included in an object file.
Support for profiling of Pentium code is also described.
.*
:OPTLIST.
.*
.if &e'&$SWd0 eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWd0' name='d0'.
.ix 'options' 'd0'
(C++ only)
No debugging information is included in the object file.
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWd1 eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWd1' name='d1'.
.ix 'options' 'd1'
Line number debugging information is included in the object file.
This option provides additional information to the &dbgname (at the
expense of larger object files and executable files).
Line numbers are handy when debugging your application with the
&dbgname at the source code level.
Code speed is not affected by this option.
To avoid recompiling, the &stripname can be used to remove debugging
information from the executable image.
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWd1pls eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWd1pls' name='d1+'.
.ix 'options' 'd1+'
(C only)
Line number debugging information plus typing information for global
symbols and local structs and arrays is included in the object file.
Although global symbol information can be made available to the
&dbgname through a &lnkname option, typing information for global
symbols and local structs and arrays must be requested when the source
file is compiled.
This option provides additional information to the &dbgname (at the
expense of larger object files and executable files).
Code speed is not affected by this option.
To avoid recompiling, the &stripname can be used to remove debugging
information from the executable image.
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWd2 eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWd2' name='d2'.
.ix 'options' 'd2'
In addition to line number information, local symbol and data
type information is included in the object file.
Although global symbol information can be made available to the
&dbgname through a &lnkname option, local symbol and typing
information must be requested when the source file is compiled.
This option provides additional information to the &dbgname (at the
expense of larger object files and executable files).
.np
By default, the compiler will select the "od" level of optimization if
"d2" is specified (see the description of the "od" option).
Starting with version 11.0, the compiler now expands functions in-line
where appropriate.
This means that symbolic information for the in-lined function will
not be available.
.np
The use of this option will make the debugging chore somewhat easier
at the expense of code speed and size.
To create production code, you should recompile without this option.
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWd2i eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWd2i' name='d2i'.
.ix 'options' 'd2i'
(C++ only)
This option is identical to "d2" but does not permit in-lining of
functions.
Functions are emitted as external out-of-line functions.
This option can result in larger object and/or executable files than
with "d2" (we are discussing both "code" and "file" size here).
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWd2s eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWd2s' name='d2s'.
.ix 'options' 'd2s'
(C++ only)
This option is identical to "d2" but does not permit in-lining of
functions.
Functions are emitted as static out-of-line functions.
This option can result in larger object and/or executable files than
with "d2" or "d2i" (we are discussing both "code" and "file" size
here).
Link times are faster than "d2i" (fewer segment relocations) but
executables are slightly larger.
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWd2t eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWd2t' name='d2t'.
.ix 'options' 'd2t'
(C++ only)
This option is identical to "d2" but does not include type name
debugging information.
This option can result in smaller object and/or executable files (we
are discussing "file" size here).
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWd3 eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWd3' name='d3'.
.ix 'options' 'd3'
This option is identical to "d2" but also includes symbolic debugging
information for unreferenced type names.
Note that this can result in very large object and/or executable files
when header files like
.fi WINDOWS.H
or
.fi OS2.H
are included.
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWd3i eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWd3i' name='d3i'.
.ix 'options' 'd3i'
(C++ only)
This option is identical to "d3" but does not permit in-lining of
functions.
Functions are emitted as external out-of-line functions.
This option can result in larger object and/or executable files than
with "d3" (we are discussing both "code" and "file" size here).
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWd3s eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWd3s' name='d3s'.
.ix 'options' 'd3s'
(C++ only)
This option is identical to "d3" but does not permit in-lining of
functions.
Functions are emitted as static out-of-line functions.
This option can result in larger object and/or executable files than
with "d3" or "d3i" (we are discussing both "code" and "file" size
here).
Link times are faster than "d3i" (fewer segment relocations) but
executables are slightly larger.
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWee eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWee' name='ee'.
.ix 'options' 'ee'
&x86only.
This option causes the compiler to generate a call to
.kwm __EPI
in the epilogue sequence at the end of every function.
This user-written routine can be used to collect/record profiling
information.
.if &e'&dohelp eq 0 .do begin
Other related options are :HDREF refid='SWep'. and
:HDREF refid='SWen'..
.do end
.ix 'macros' '__SW_EE'
The macro
.kwm __SW_EE
will be predefined if "ee" is selected.
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWen eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWen' name='en'.
.ix 'options' 'en'
&x86only.
The compiler will emit the function name into the object code as a
string of characters just before the function prologue sequence is
generated.
The string is terminated by a byte count of the number of characters
in the string.
.millust begin
    ; void Toaster( int arg )

            db      "Toaster", 7

            .
            ret
.millust end
.pc
This option is intended for developers of embedded systems (ROM-based
applications).
It may also be used in conjunction with the "ep" option
for special user-written profiling applications.
.ix 'macros' '__SW_EN'
The macro
.kwm __SW_EN
will be predefined if "en" is selected.
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWep eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWep' name='ep'.[<number>]
.ix 'options' 'ep'
&x86only.
This option causes the compiler to generate a call to a user-written
.kwm __PRO
routine in the prologue sequence at the start of every function.
This routine can be used to collect/record profiling information.
The optional argument
.sy <number>
can be used to cause the compiler to allocate that many bytes on the
stack as a place for
.kwm __PRO
to store information.
.if &e'&dohelp eq 0 .do begin
Other related options are :HDREF refid='SWee'. and
:HDREF refid='SWen'..
.do end
.ix 'macros' '__SW_EP'
The macro
.kwm __SW_EP
will be predefined if "ep" is selected.
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWet eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWet' name='et'.
.ix 'options' 'et'
(Pentium only)
This option causes the compiler to generate code into the prolog of
each function to count exactly how much time is spent within that
function, in clock ticks.
This option is valid only for Pentium compatible processors (i.e., the
instructions inserted into the code do not work on 486 or earlier
architectures).
The Pentium "rdtsc" opcode is used to obtain the instruction cycle
count.
.np
At the end of the execution of the program, a file will be written to
the same location as the executable, except with a "&prf" extension.
The contents of the file will look like this:
.exam begin
          1903894223          1  main
          1785232334    1376153  StageA

           225730118         99  StageD
.exam end
.np
The first column is the total number of clock ticks spent inside of
the function during the execution of the program,
the second column is the number of times it was called
and the third column is the individual function name.
The total number of clock ticks includes time spent within functions
called from this function.
.np
The overhead of the profiling can be somewhat intrusive, especially
for small leaf functions (i.e., it may skew your results somewhat).
.if '&target' eq 'QNX' .do begin
.np
Some versions of QNX emulate the "rdtsc" opcode on earlier processors
by catching the invalid opcode fault and fishing the timer.
Thus, the "et" option may work on other processors but will be a lot
less accurate on non-Pentium processors.

:OPT refid='SWhwdc' name='h'.{w,d,c}
.ix 'debugging information format'
.ix 'options' 'hw'
.ix 'options' 'hd'
.ix 'options' 'hc'
The type of debugging information that is to be included in the object
file is one of "&company", "DWARF" or "Codeview".
The default is "DWARF".
.np
If you wish to use the Microsoft Codeview debugger, then choose the
"hc" option (this option causes Codeview Level 4 information to be
generated).
.ix 'CVPACK'
.ix 'Debugging Information Compactor'
It will be necessary to run the Microsoft Debugging Information
Compactor, CVPACK, on the executable once the linker has created it.
For information on requesting the linker to automatically run CVPACK,
see the section entitled "OPTION CVPACK" in the
.if '&target' eq 'QNX' .do begin
part of this guide that describes the &lnkname..
.do end
.el .do begin
.book &lnkname User's Guide.

.ix 'stack overflow'
.ix 'options' 's'
Stack overflow checking is omitted from the generated code.
By default, the compiler will emit code at the beginning of every
function that checks for the "stack overflow" condition.
This option can be used to disable this feature.
.ix 'macros' '__SW_S'
The macro
.kwm __SW_S
will be predefined if "s" is selected.
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWsi eq 1 .do begin

pattern.
This option is useful for debugging an application since it sets up
the stack frame with a predictable pattern.

The macro
.kwm __SW_SI
will be predefined if "si" is selected.

This group of options deals with the compiler preprocessor.
.*
:OPTLIST.
.*
.if &e'&$SWd eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWd' name='d'.<name>[=text]
.ix 'options' 'd'
This option can be used to define a preprocessor macro from the
command line.
If
.us =text
is not specified, then 1 is assumed.
In other words, specifying
.mono &sw.dDBGON
is equivalent to specifying
.mono &sw.dDBGON=1
on the command line.
.np
If
.us =text
is specified, then this option is equivalent to including the
following line in your source code.
.millust begin
#define name text
.millust end
.np
Consider the following example.
.exam begin 1
d_MODDATE="87.05.04"
.exam end
.pc
The above example is equivalent to a line in the source file
containing:
.millust begin
#define _MODDATE "87.05.04"
.millust end
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWdpls eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWdpls' name='d+'.
.ix 'options' 'd+'
The syntax of any "d" option which follows on the command line is
extended to include &lang tokens as part of "text".
The token string is terminated by a space character.
This permits more complex syntax than is normally allowed.
.exam begin 1
&sw.d+ &sw.d_radx=x*3.1415926/180
.exam end
.np
This is equivalent to specifying the following in the source code.
.exam begin 1
#define _radx x*3.1415926/180
.exam end
.np
&cmppname extends this feature by allowing parameterized macros.
When a parameter list is specified, the "=" character must not be
specified.
It also permits immediate definition of the macro as shown in the
second line of the example.
.exam begin 2
&sw.d+ &sw.d_rad(x)x*3.1415926/180
&sw.d+_rad(x)x*3.1415926/180

#define _rad(x) x*3.1415926/180
.exam end
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWfo eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWfo' name='fo'.[=<file_name>] (preprocessor)
.ix 'options' 'fo'
.ix 'preprocessor'
The "fo" option is used with any form of the "p" (preprocessor) option
to name the output file &drive, path, file name and extension.
If the output file name is not specified, it is constructed from the
source file name.
If the output file extension is not specified, it is "&pxt" by
default.
.exam begin 1
&prompt.:SF font=1.compiler_name:eSF. report &sw.p &sw.fo=&dr4.&pc.proj&pc.prep&pc
.exam end
.pc
A trailing "&pc" must be specified for directory names.
If, for example, the option was specified as
.mono fo=&dr4&pc.proj&pc.prep
then the output file would be called
.fi &dr4.&pc.proj&pc.prep.i
.period
A default filename extension must be preceded by a period (".").

.exam end
.do end
.if &e'&$SWpil eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWpil' name='pil'.
.ix 'options' 'pil'
By default, #line directives embedded in source files are processed and
will be used as a basis for file name and line number information in error
messages, __FILE__ and __LINE__ symbols, etc. The "pil" option causes the
preprocessor to ignore #line directives and refer to actual file names and
line numbers.
.do end

.ix 'options' 'pe'
.ix 'options' 'pl'
.ix 'options' 'pw'
.ix 'preprocessor'
The input file is preprocessed and, by default, is written to the
standard output file.
The "fo" option may be used to redirect the output to a file with
default extension "&pxt".
.np
.ix 'preprocessor' 'source comments'
Specify "pc" if you wish to include the original source comments in
the &product preprocessor output file.
.np
.ix 'preprocessor' 'encryption'
(C++ Only) Specify "pe" if you wish to encrypt the original
identifiers when they are written to the &product preprocessor output
file.
.np
.ix 'line directive'
.ix '#line'
.ix 'preprocessor' '#line directives'
Specify "pl" if you wish to include
.id #line
directives.
.np
Specify "pcl" or "plc" if you wish both source comments and #line
directives.
.np
Use the "w=<num>" suffix if you wish to wish output lines to wrap at
<num> columns.
Zero means no wrap.
.exam begin 1
&prompt.:SF font=1.compiler_name:eSF. report &sw.pcelw=80
.exam end
.np
The input file is preprocessed only.
When only "p" is specified, source comments and #line directives are
not included.
You must request these using the "c" and "l" suffixes.
When the output of the preprocessor is fed into the compiler,
the
.id #line
directive enables the compiler to issue diagnostics in terms of line
numbers of the original source file.
.np
The options which are supported when the &product preprocessor is
requested are: "d", "fi", "fo", "i", "m?", and "u".
.do end

in error messages.
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWeq eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWeq' name='eq'.
.ix 'options' 'eq'

:optref refid='SWfr'..
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWer eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWer' name='er'.
.ix 'options' 'er'
(C++ only)
This option causes the C++ compiler to not recover from undefined
symbol errors.
By default, the compiler recovers from "undefined symbol" errors by
injecting a special entry into the symbol table that prevents further
issuance of diagnostics relating to the use of the same name.
Specify the "er" option if you want all uses of the symbol to be
diagnosed.
.exam begin

The "t" option is used to set the tab stop interval.
By default, the compiler assumes a tab stop occurs at multiples

When the compiler reports a line number and column number in a
diagnostic message, the column number has been adjusted for

When using the C compiler, anonymous structs/unions are allowed
(this is always permitted in C++).

.exam end
.pc
According to a strict interpretation of the ISO C standard, the
function prototype introduces a new scope which is terminated at the
semicolon (;).
The effect of this is that the structure tag "a" in the function "foo"
is not the same structure tag "a" defined after the prototype.
A diagnostic must be issued for a conforming ISO C implementation.
.note
A trailing comma (,) is allowed after the last constant in an enum
declaration.
.exam begin 1
enum colour { RED, GREEN, BLUE, };
.exam end
.note
The ISO requirement that all enums have a base type of
.us int
is relaxed.
The motivation for this extension is conservation of storage.
Many enums can be represented by integral types that are smaller
in size than an
.us int.

void foo( void )
{
    enum colour x;

    x = RED;
}
.exam end
.pc
In the example, "x" can be stored in an
.us unsigned char
because its values span the range 0 to 2.
.note
The ISO requirement that the base type of a bitfield be
.us int
or
.us unsigned
is relaxed.
This allows a programmer to allocate bitfields from smaller units of
storage than an
.us int
(e.g.,
.us unsigned char
.ct ).

By default, the compiler places in the object file the names of the C
libraries that correspond to the memory model and floating-point
options that were selected.
The &lnkname uses these library names to select the libraries required
to link the application.
If you use the "zl" option, the library names will not be included in
the generated object file.
.np
The compiler may generate external references for library code that
conveniently cause the linker to link in different code.
One such case is: if you have any functions that pass or return
floating-point values (i.e., float or double), the compiler will
insert an external reference that will cause the floating-point
formatting routines to be included in the executable.
The "zl" option will disable these external references.

Use this option when you wish to create a library of object modules
which do not contain &product library name references.

The "xr" option is used to to enable the use of the C++ feature called
Run-Time Type Information (RTTI).
RTTI can only be used with classes that have virtual functions
declared.
This restriction implies that if you enable RTTI, the amount of
storage used for a class in memory does not change.
The RTTI information is added to the virtual function information
block so there will be an increase in the executable size if you
choose to enable RTTI.
There is no execution penalty at all unless you use the dynamic_cast<>
feature in which case, you should be aware that the operation requires
a lookup operation in order to perform the conversion properly.
You can mix and match modules compiled with and without "xr", with the
caveat that dynamic_cast<> and typeid() may not function (return NULL
or throw an exception) if used on a class instance that was not
compiled with the "xr" option.

a structure.
The default is "zp2" for the 16-bit compiler and "zp8" for 32-bit
compiler.
The alignment of structure members is described in the following
table.
If the size of the member is 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16, the alignment is given
for each of the "zp" options.
If the member of the structure is an array or structure, the alignment
is described by the row "x".

.millust end
.pc
An alignment of 0 means no alignment, 2 means word boundary, 4 means
doubleword boundary, etc.
.np
Note that packed structures are padded to ensure that consecutive
occurrences of the same structure in memory are aligned appropriately.
This is illustrated when the following example is compiled with "zp4".
The amount of padding is determined as follows.
If the largest member of structure "s" is 1 byte then "s" is not
aligned.
If the largest member of structure "s" is 2 bytes then "s" is aligned
according to row 2.
If the largest member of structure "s" is 4 bytes then "s" is aligned
according to row 4.
If the largest member of structure "s" is 8 bytes then "s" is aligned
according to row 8.
At present, there are no scalar objects that can have a size of 16
bytes.
If the largest member of structure "s" is an array or structure then
"s" is aligned according to row "x".
Padding is the inclusion of slack bytes at the end of a structure in
order to guarantee the alignment of consecutive occurrences of the
same structure in memory.
.np
To understand why structure member alignment may be important,
consider the following example.

In the above example, the default alignment "zp8" will cause the
pointer and integer items to be aligned on even addresses
although the array "date" is 9 bytes in length.
The items are 2-byte aligned when sizeof(item) is 2 and 4-byte
aligned when sizeof(item) is 4.
.np
On computer systems that have a 16-bit (or 32-bit) bus, improved
performance can be obtained when pointer, integer and floating-point
items are aligned on an even boundary.
This could be done by careful rearrangement of the fields of the
structure or it can be forced by use of the "zp" option.

.ix 'options' 'zt'
The "data threshold" option is used to set the maximum size for data
objects to be included in the default data segment.
This option can be used with the compact, large, and huge (16-bit)
memory models only.
These are memory models where there can be more than one data segment.
Normally, all data objects whose size is less than or equal to the
threshold value are placed in the default data segment "_DATA" unless
they are specifically declared to be
.kwm far
items.
When there is a large amount of static data, it is often useful to
set the data threshold size so that all objects larger than this size
are placed in another (far) data segment.
For example, the option "zt100" causes all data objects larger than
100 bytes in size to be implicitly declared as
.kwm far
and grouped in other data segments.
.np
The default data threshold value is 32767.
Thus, by default, all objects greater than 32767 bytes in size are
implicitly declared as
.kwm far
and will be placed in other data segments.
If the "zt" option is specified without a size, the data threshold
value is 256.
The largest value that can be specified is 32767 (a larger value will
result in 256 being selected).
.np
If the "zt" option is used to compile any module in a program, then
you must compile all the other modules in the program with the same
option (and value).
.np
Care must be exercised when declaring the size of objects in different
modules.
Consider the following declarations in two different C files.
Suppose we define an array in one module as follows:
.millust begin
extern int Array[100] = { 0 };
.millust end
and, suppose we reference the same array in another module as follows:
.millust begin
extern int Array[10];
.millust end
.pc
Assuming that these modules were compiled with the option "zt100",
we would have a problem.
In the first module, the array would be placed in another segment
since
.id Array[100]
is bigger than the data threshold.
In the second module, the array would be placed in the default data
segment since
.id Array[10]
is smaller than the data threshold.
The extra code required to reference the object in another data
segment would not be generated.
.np
Note that this problem can also occur even when the "zt" option
is not used (i.e., for objects greater than 32767 bytes in size).
There are two solutions to this problem: (1) be consistent when
declaring an object's size, or, (2) do not specify the size in data
reference declarations.

Contact Intel directly for more information on the issue.

As a result, the run-time system startup code has been modified to

If the Pentium FDIV flaw is a concern for your application, there are
two approaches that you could take:
.autonote
.note
You may test the
.mono __chipbug
variable in your code in all floating-point and memory models and take
appropriate action (such as display a warning message or discontinue
the application).
.note
Alternately, you can use the "fpd" option when compiling your code.
This option directs the compiler to generate additional code whenever
an FDIV instruction is generated which tests the low order bit of
.mono __chipbug
and, if on, calls the software workaround code in the math libraries.
If the bit is off, an in-line FDIV instruction will be performed as
before.

The "near call" optimization for static functions in large code models
is disabled (e.g., the function

in the example above will never be "near called".
Static functions will always be "far called" in large code models.
.point
Near static functions will still be "near called"
(e.g., the function
.id foo1
is "near called" in the example above).
However, this can lead to problems at link time if the caller function
ends up in a different segment from the called function (the linker
will issue a message if this is the case).
.point
The "common epilogue" optimization is lost.
.point
.ix 'ELIMINATE linker option'
The linker "OPTION ELIMINATE" must be specified when linking an
application to take advantage of the granularity inherent in object
files/libraries compiled with this option.
.point
Any assumptions about relative position of functions are
invalid. Consider the following code which attempts to determine
the size of a code region by subtracting function addresses:
.exam begin
region_size = (unsigned long)&function2 - (unsigned long)function1;
.exam end
When "zm" is in effect,
.id region_size
may be extremely large or even
a negative value. For the above code to work as intended, both
.id function1
and
.id function2
(and every function intended to be located between them) must reside
 in a single code segment.

.np
Instead of placing each function in a segment with a different name,
the code generator will place each function in a segment with the same
name (the name of the module suffixed by "_TEXT").
.np
The advantages to this option are:
.autopoint
.point
All functions in a module will reside in the same physical segment in
an executable.
.point
The "near call" optimization for static functions in large code models
is not disabled (e.g., the function
.id foo
in the example above will be "near called".
Static functions will always be "near called" in large code models.
.point
The problem associated with calling "near" functions goes away since
all functions in a module will reside in the same physical segment
(e.g., the function
.id foo1
is "near" in the example above).
.endpoint
.np
The disadvantages to this option are:
.autopoint
.point
The size of a physical segment is restricted to 64K in 16-bit
applications.
Although this may limit the number of functions that can be placed in
the segment, the restriction is only on a "per module" basis.

Although less constricting, the size of a physical segment is
restricted to 4G in a 32-bit application.

:OPTLIST.
.*
.if &e'&$SWoa eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWoa' name='oa'.
.ix 'options' 'oa'
.ix 'aliasing'
Alias checking is relaxed.
When this option is specified, the code optimizer will assume that
global variables are not indirectly referenced through pointers.
This assumption may reduce the size of the code that is generated.
The following example helps to illustrate this point.
.exam begin 10
extern int i;

void rtn( int *pi )
{
    int k;
    for( k = 0; k < 10; ++k ) {
        (*pi)++;
        i++;
    }
}
.exam end
.pc
In the above example, if "i" and "*pi" referenced the same integer
object then "i" would be incremented by 2 each time through the
"for" loop and we would call the pointer reference "*pi" an alias
for the variable "i".
In this situation, the compiler could not bind the variable "i" to
a register without making sure that the "in-memory" copy of "i" was
kept up-to-date.
In most cases, the above situation does not arise.
Rarely would we reference the same variable directly by name and
indirectly through a pointer in the same routine.
The "oa" option instructs the code generator that such cases do not
arise in the module to be compiled.
The code generator will be able to produce more efficient code when
it does not have to worry about the alias "problem".
.np
.ix 'macros' '__SW_OA'
The macro
.kwm __SW_OA
will be predefined if "oa" is selected.
.do end
.*
.if &e'&$SWob eq 1 .do begin
:OPT refid='SWob' name='ob'.
.ix 'options' 'ob'
When the "ob" option is specified, the code generator will try to
order the blocks of code emitted such that the "expected" execution
path (as determined by a set of simple heuristics) will be straight
through, with other cases being handled by jumps to separate blocks of
code "out of line".
This will result in better cache utilization on the Pentium.
If the heuristics do not apply to your code, it could result in a
performance decrease.
.do end

.ix 'options' 'oe'
Certain user functions are expanded in-line.
The criteria for which functions are selected for in-line expansion is
based on the "size" of the function in terms of the number of "tree nodes"
generated by the function.
Functions are internally represented as tree structures, where each
operand and each operator is a node of the tree.
For example, the statement
.mono a = -b * (c + d)
can be represented as a tree with 8 nodes, one for each operand and
operator.
.np
The number of "nodes" generated corresponds closely with the number
of operators used in an expression.
Functions which require more than "<num>" nodes are not expanded
in-line.
The default number is 20. With larger "<num>" values, more (larger)
functions will be expanded in-line.
This optimization is especially useful when locally-referenced
functions are small in size.

        B2 *p2 = p;
        p2->b2 = 0;
}
.millust end
.pc
In this example, the C++ compiler must ensure that
.id p1
and
.id p2
become NULL if
.id p
is NULL (since no offset adjustment is allowed for a NULL pointer).
However, the first executable statement implies that
.id p

This option causes the compiler to recognize double-byte characters
in strings.
When the compiler scans a text string enclosed in quotes ("),
it will recognize the first byte of a double-byte character and
suppress lexical analysis of the second byte.
This will prevent the compiler from misinterpreting the second byte as
a "\" or quote (") character.
.begnote
.note zk, zk0
These options cause the compiler to process strings for Japanese
double-byte characters (range 0x81 - 0x9F and 0xE0 - 0xFC).
The characters in the range A0 - DF are single-byte Katakana.
.note zk1
This option causes the compiler to process strings for Traditional
Chinese and Taiwanese double-byte characters (range 0x81 - 0xFC).
.note zk2
This option causes the compiler to process strings for Korean Hangeul
double-byte characters (range 0x81 - 0xFD).
.note zkl
This option causes the compiler to process strings using the current
code page.
If the local character set includes double-byte characters then string
processing will check for lead bytes.

Characters in wide characters (L'c') and wide strings (L"string") are
translated to UNICODE.
The UNICODE translate table for the specified code page is loaded
from a file.
The compiler locates this file by searching the paths listed in the
.if '&target' eq 'QNX' .do begin

.do end
.el .do begin
.ev PATH
.do end
environment variable.

:OPT refid='SWvcap' name='vcap'.
.ix 'options' 'vcap'
This options tells the compiler to allow
.kw _alloca()
to be used in a parameter list.
The optimizer has to do extra work to allow this but since it is rare
(and easily worked around if you can), you have to ask the optimizer
to handle this case.
You also may get less efficient code in some cases.

.ix 'save/restore segment registers'
.ix 'options' 'r'
This option instructs the compiler to generate function prologue and
epilogue sequences that save and restore any segment registers that
are modified by the function.
Caution should be exercised when using this option.
If the value of the segment register being restored matches the value
of a segment that was freed within the function, a general protection
fault will occur in protected-mode environments.
When this option is used, the compiler also assumes that called functions
save and restore segment registers.
By default, the compiler does not generate code to save and restore
segment registers.
This option is provided for compatibility with the version 8.0 release.

Use this option if you want to generate __stdcall function names that
will be compatible with version 10.0 of the compilers.
When this option is omitted,
all C symbols (extern "C" symbols in C++) are suffixed by "@nnn" where
"nnn" is the sum of the argument sizes (each size is rounded up to a
multiple of 4 bytes so that char and short are size 4).
When the argument list contains "...", the "@nnn" suffix is omitted.
This convention is compatible with Microsoft.
For more information on the __stdcall convention see the section
entitled :HDREF refid='wccext'..
